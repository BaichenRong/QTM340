    "A URL (\"uniform resource locator\") uniquely identifies a document on the web, and provides instructions for how to access it. It's the thing you type into your web browser's address bar. It's what you cut-and-paste when you want to e-mail an article to a friend. In fact, most of what we do on the web---whether we're using a web browser or writing a program that accesses the web---boils down to manipulating URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand the structure of URLs so we can take them apart and put them back together (both in our heads and programmatically). URLs have a conventional structure that is specified in Internet standards documentation, and many web APIs assume knowledge of this structure. So let's take the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    http://www.example.com/foo/bar?arg1=baz&arg2=quux\n",
    "    \n",

    "* The *host* specifies which server on the Internet we're going to talk to in order to retrieve the document we want.\n",
    "* The *path* names a resource on the server, often using slashes (`/`) to represent hierarchical relationships between resources. (Sometimes this corresponds to actual files on the server, but just as often it does not.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The most common format for documents on the web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML was specifically designed to be a tool for creating web pages, and it excels at that. But it's not so great for describing structured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But another popular format---and the format we'll be learning how to work with today---is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Like HTML, JSON is a format for exchanging structured data between two computer programs. Unlike HTML, JSON is primarily intended to communicate content, rather than layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw that already when we accessed the reponses to the \"Yes or No\" API via our web browser just a minute ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, whenever a web site exposes a URL for human readers, the document at that URL is in HTML. Whenever a web site exposes a URL for programmatic use, the document at that URL is in JSON. (There are other formats commonly used for computer-readable documents, like XML. But let's keep it simple for now.) To review:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes or No has both a human-readable version of its page found at this URL, written in HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://yesno.wtf/\n",
    "\n",
    "and a version of the same content designed to be easily readable by computers. This is the URL, and it returns a document in JSON format, as we saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://yesno.wtf/api/\n",

Often---as is the case with Facebook-- these are just two views into the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, another way to define a web API is as follows: \n",

    "**API: A set of URLs, and rules for manipulating URLs, that a website makes available and that are intended to be read by computer programs.** \n",

    "### A Note about API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, when playing around with APIs via your web browser, you will see this message (or one like it):\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\"message\": \"unauthorized\", \"type\": \"error\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "This message results from the fact that most web APIs (unlike most web pages) require some kind of *authentication*. \"Authentication\" here means some kind of information that associates the request with an individual. In many APIs, this takes the form of a \"token\" or \"key\" (also called a \"client ID\" and/or \"secret\")---most usually an extra parameter that you pass on the end of the URL (or in an HTTP header) that identifies the request as having come from a unique user. Some services (like Facebook) provide a subset of functionality to non-authenticated (\"anonymous\") requests; others require authentication for all requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you get \"keys\" or \"tokens\"? There's usually some kind of sign-up form in or near the developer documentation for the service in question. The form may ask you for a description of your application; it's usually safe to leave this blank, or to put in some placeholder text. Only rarely is this text reviewed by an actual human being; your key is usually issued automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different services have different requirements regarding how to include your keys in your request; you'll have to consult the documentation to know for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API we'll be using for the next exercise, Wordnik, requires a key. But we can use a pre-existing one which you'll see below. (When we get to the exercise after that, using the Genius API, you'll need to sign up for your own).  "

    "\n",
    "All you need to make (most) web API requests is a web browser. But it would be tedious to do these requests in a web browser and then copy over the responses into Python for analysis. We may also want to make *many* requests to a web API (for example, to get the song IDs for *all* of the songs included in our candidate playlist), which is inconvenient to do \"by hand\" with a web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, there would be some way to make web requests *directly inside a Python program* and in fact, we've already used it: the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) package.\n",
