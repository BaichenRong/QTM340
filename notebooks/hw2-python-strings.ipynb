    "In this homework, we'll learn a bit more about Python's string manipulation functions (of obvious relevance to this class). Another goal of this homework is to make you feel more comfortable with programming in Python, rather than R, as well as to feel more comfortable Googling when things don't work out and/or you need to learn how to do something in Python that you know how to do in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we get started, a quick note on Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main \"branches\" of Python in current use: Python 2 and Python 3. Both of these branches have their own versions: the latest version of Python 2 (as of this writing) is Python 2.7.18, and the latest version of Python 3 is Python 3.9.5. The branches and versions all have slightly different capabilities and their syntax and structure are slightly different. Python 2 still has a larger number of users, but most data scientists using Python today use the newer version. Following their lead, we'll be using Python 3 in this course (specifically, the version included with our JupyterHub instance). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason you need to know about the two branches of Python is that you should be careful when looking up Python information on the Internet. This is fine do to, and even expected, but you should make sure whatever tutorial / sample code / StackOverflow thread / etc you're looking at is about Python 3, not Python 2."

    "\n",
    "When you're writing a computer program, you're describing to the computer what you want, and then asking the computer to figure that thing out for you. Your description of what you want is called an *expression*. The process that the computer uses to turn your expression into whatever that expression means is called *evaluation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a science fiction movie where a character asks the computer, out loud, \"What's the square root of nine billion?\" or \"How many people older than 50 live in Paris, France?\" Those are examples of expressions. The process that the computer uses to transform those expressions into a response is evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've talked about two \"functions\" so far: `len()` and `type()`. A function is a special word that you can use in Python expressions that runs some pre-defined code: you put your expression inside the parentheses, and Python sends the result of evaluating that expression to the code in the function. That code operates on the value that you gave it, and then itself evaluates to another value. Using a function in this way is usually called \"calling\" it or \"invoking\" it. The stuff that you put inside the parentheses is called a \"parameter\" or \"argument\"; the value that the function gives back is called its \"return value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function diagram](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/functiondiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` and `type()` functions are two of what are called \"built-in functions,\" i.e. functions that come with Python and are available whenever you're writing Python code. In Python, built-in functions tend to be able to take many different types of value as parameters. ([There are a lot of other built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html), not just `len()` and `type()`! We'll discuss them as the need arises.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: You can also write your own functions---we'll learn how to do this later in the class. Writing functions is a good way to avoid repetition in your code and to compartmentalize it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Methods\" work a lot like functions, except in how it looks when you use them. Instead of putting the expression that you want to use them with inside the parentheses, you put the call to the method directly AFTER the expression that you want to call it on, following a period (`.`). Methods, unlike built-in functions, are usually only valid for one type of value; e.g., values of the string type have a `.strip()` method, but integer values don't.\n",
