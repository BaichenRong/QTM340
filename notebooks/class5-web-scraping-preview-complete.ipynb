    "To perform practical approaches to data science with text, we need...**text**. Some text is prepared for computational analysis and publicly available in digital libraries. We can easily get novels in the public domain as .txt files, for example, from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Or we can work with text from HathiTrust's vast collections through the [HathiTrust Research Center](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/). \n",

    "If we want to work with text from popular culture and the internet--and we do!--we often need to scrape the web. And in order to scrape the web, we need to learn a little bit about HTML. So that's where we'll be starting today."

    "First we're going to use Developer Tools in Chrome to take a look at how `kittens.html` is organized. Click on the \"rendered version\" link above. In Chrome, ctrl-click (or right click) anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect Element.\" This will open Chrome's Developer Tools. Your screen should look (something) like this:\n",

    "In the upper panel, you see the web page you're inspecting. In the lower panel, you see a version of the HTML source code, with little arrows next to some of the lines. (The little arrows allow you to collapse parts of the HTML source that are hierarchically related.) As you move your mouse over the elements in the top panel, different parts of the source code will be highlighted. Chrome is showing you which parts of the source code are causing which parts of the page to show up. Pretty nice!\n",

    "Also note that this relationship works in reverse: you can move your mouse over some part of the source code in the lower panel, which will highlight in the top panel what that source code corresponds to on the page. We'll be using this later to visually identify the parts of the page that are interesting to us, so we can write code that extracts the contents of those parts automatically."
