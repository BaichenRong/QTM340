    "## Getting started with NLP and Sentiment Analysis ##\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lauren F. Klein wrote version 1.0 of this notebook, based off [Sentiment Analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis) by Zöe Wilkinson Saldaña with additional info by [Parul Pandey](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/simplifying-social-media-sentiment-analysis-using-vader-in-python-f9e6ec6fc52f). It was updated in 2020 by Dan Sinykin and again by Lauren Klein in 2021.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have learned to access APIs, scrape, parse, and clean text. We're ready for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) names a broad range of techniques that involve applying computational analytical methods to text. (\"Natural language\" in this context just means human language as opposed to a programming language, like Python). In this unit, we'll explore many popular NLP techniques, beginning with sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a method of quantifying the \"sentiment,\" or emotional intensity, of words and phrases in a text. Some sentiment analysis tools, including the one we'll be working with today, also factor in the emotional weight of other features of language, such as punctuation marks or emojis. In general, sentiment analysis processes a unit of text (a sentence, a paragraph, a book, an email, a song, a tweet) and outputs scores or other classifications that indicate whether that unit of text conveys a positive or negative sentiment (according to the particular algorithm and dictionary employed). Some tools go as far as to quantify the *degree* of positivity or degree of negativity within a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "How might this be helpful? A researcher interested in attitudes toward a political event, for example, might use sentiment analysis to characterize how people describe that event on Twitter. Combined with geographic data, sentiment analysis can be used to make comparisons across regions. Combined with demographic data, sentiment analysis can be used to understand how different groups of people view any particular event (or issue, or individual). Sentiment analysis can be easily scaled up, which makes it possible to analyze hundreds of thousands or even millions of speech events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any computational tool, sentiment analysis has limitations that must be taken into account. We'll explore some of those in our readings and in your next quiz. But when wielding sentiment analysis critically *and* creatively, it can lead to interesting results."

    "### NLTK and VADER ###\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using a few tools from Python's [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) (short for Natural Language Toolkit) to generate sentiment scores for the corpus that we created in Unit 1: the lyrics of the candidate playlists that we scraped from Genius.com. After completing today's other Jupyter notebook, you should have those lyrics in a directory in your \"my-work\" folder on JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a collection of libraries and tools that help researchers apply computational methods to texts. It's been in development since 2001--almost as old as you (or older)!--and it's used widely in the field of NLP. The tools included in NLTK range from methods of breaking up text into smaller pieces, to identifying whether a word belongs in a given language, to providing sample corpora (that's the plural of corpus) that researchers can use for training and development purposes. We'll be using NLTK a lot in the coming weeks. As with the previous unit, I'll introduce you to its features as we require them for our specific goals.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will be using one NLTK tool: [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) (short for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), which generates positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores for textual input.\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER has a lot of advantages over traditional methods of sentiment analysis, including:\n",
    "* It works well on social media text, yet readily generalizes to multiple domains;\n",
    "* It doesn’t require training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon;\n",
    "* It is fast enough to be used online with streaming data, and;\n",
    "* It does not severely suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of the above is an easy-to-read paper published by the creaters of VADER library, one of whom use to be my colleague at Georgia Tech. You can read it [here](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf)."

    "### Sentiment Lexicons, Sentiment Intensity, and Context-Awareness ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, sentiment analysis worked by comparing text to a list of lexical features (i.e. words) that were determined by people to be either positive or negative. These are known as *sentiment lexicons.* (It's possible to create lexicons for other types of language as well; we'll talk about this more in the coming few days, as well as in Unit 3, when we discuss modeling in more detail.) \n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, tools have improved upon the positive/negative binary by offering more fine-tuned distinctions between varying degrees of positivity and negativity. This is known as *sentiment intensity*, and VADER does this well. For example, VADER scores “comfort” as moderately positive and “euphoria” as extremely positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "VADER also attempts to capture and score textual features common in informal online text such as capitalizations, exclamation points, and emoticons, as shown in the table below:\n",

    "### Caveat Emptor! ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any text analysis tool, VADER should be evaluated critically and in the context of the assumptions it makes about communication. VADER was developed to analyze English language microblogging and social media sites (especially Twitter). This context is more informal than, for instance, political speeches; and more contemporary than, for instance, Shakespeare. But VADER was also developed as a general purpose sentiment analyzer, and the authors’ initial study shows it compares favorably against tools that have been trained for specific domains, use specialized lexicons, or resource-heavy machine learning techniques. That said, sentiment analysis continues to struggle to capture complex sentiments like irony, sarcasm, and mockery, when the average reader would be able to make the distinction between the literal text and its intended meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more caveats: while VADER is a good general purpose tool for English language texts, VADER only provides partial native support for non-English texts (it detects emojis/capitalization/etc., but not word choice). The developers encourage users to use automatic translation to pre-process non-English texts and then input the results into VADER. There might be better tools for non-English language texts. \n",
