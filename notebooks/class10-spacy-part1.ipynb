    "## Introducing spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "Although NLTK lets you do pretty much anything NLP-related, it can sometimes be difficult to parse through all of the different ways that you might approach a specific task. Enter spaCy, a more recent and more user-friendly NLP library, which has become increasingly widespread, particularly for certain core NLP tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named-entitiy recognition (NER). We'll be using both NLTK and spaCy during this course, as do most people, since each have their strengths and weaknesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to know (and like!) about spaCy is that it relies on machine learning models trained on large amounts of carefully-labeled text. (This is in contrast to the \"large language models\" that we began the course by talking about, which \"learn\" language features in other ways.) The English-language spaCy model that we’re going to use in this lesson was trained on an annotated corpus called “OntoNotes”: 2 million+ words drawn from “news, broadcast, talk shows, weblogs, usenet newsgroups, and conversational telephone speech,” which were meticulously tagged by a group of researchers and professionals for people’s names and places, for nouns and verbs, for subjects and objects, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to know (but maybe not like?!) about spaCY is that, like a lot of other major machine learning projects, OntoNotes was sponsored by the Defense Advaced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the branch of the Defense Department that develops technology for the U.S. military. So, in short, it's complicated! \n",
