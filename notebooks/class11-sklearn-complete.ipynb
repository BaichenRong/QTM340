    "Thus far, we've examined words in terms of their grammar and syntax. We've also looked at words in terms of various units: the word, the line, the document, etc. We've also touched on the idea of ngrams: short sequences of *n* words in a row (e.g. 2-grams or *bigrams*, 3-grams or *trigrams*, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out, however, we'll be taking a different approach. We'll be turning words into numbers, and then applying statistical measures and models to the numbers that represent the words. Things like tf-idf, topic modeling, BERT, similarity, classification, and clustering--the set of methods we'll be learning in the second half of the course--all rely on this basic transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the actual transformation from words into numbers may be (relatively) easy to do, thanks to scikit-learn (or sklearn), it represents a major conceptual shift. For this reason, we're going to take some time to sit with it. For today, we'll just introduce ourselves to the concept via sk-learn, Python's major machine learning library which also happens to be crucial to many of the more advanced methods named above. "

    "We'll begin by importing sk-learn's `CountVectorizer`, which [converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html). I've used the word \"token\" in passing before, but here I'll take a minute to formally define it, along with some related terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [Stanford NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html), a *token* is \"an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing.\" The unit of the token is usually the word, but it can also be the sentence, the subword, or anything else that makes sense for that particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take this famous phrase, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To be or not to be\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This line has six tokens: \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\", \"to\", \"be\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It has four features: \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, what is a feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a *feature* is a unique token in the corpus. (Caveat: features, like tokens, can actually be anything that makes sense for the task, but for the purposes of turning words into numbers, features are most often unique words, or \"terms,\" as they're also sometimes called).\n",
    "\n",
    "When sk-learn's CountVectorizer does its thing, it first *tokenizes* all of the documents in the corpus--that is, it breaks up each document into its individual tokens--and then then creates a *document-term matrix* that counts up how many times each term, or feature, appears in each document. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the document-term matrix for the line above might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | to | be | or | not |\n",
    "|---|----|----|----|-----|\n",
    "|   | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add in the second part of that phrase as a new document, we might get something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|         | to | be | or | not | that | is | the | question |\n",
    "|---------|----|----|----|-----|------|----|-----|----------|\n",
    "| line 1  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1   | 0    | 0  | 0   | 0        |\n",
