We have a really well-run [network], which I did not take advantage of when I was in schoolor when I graduated. Now, having worked with it a lot, especially in the film program, it's amazing whatthey do as far as connecting with the alumni.I think by and large most alumni will respond if they got an email from a student, so take advantage ofthat.Take a lot of interesting courses. You don't get a chance to do it ever again. Try to take courses that youhope will someday be relevant to you but [make sure to] take ones that aren't relevant to you, justbecause you can.[College is] a unique part of your life, and [you should] challenge yourself while you're there. Don't go intoclass with a closed mind. Open your mind to a lot of the different things that you're going to hear andlearn about.Emory has grown so much as [a] school, with the types of student that are there now. When I see thefolks that are there when I go to lecture, it just amazes me. I think the caliber of students that are nowcoming out of Emory continues to increase.Develop a really good social network, and try to keep in touch with those people because you all startmoving through the business world all at the same time.I think it is key that if you're thinking about grad school and you don't feel like you're absolutely ready todive into it, then taking some time off before you [go to graduate school] is a good thing. I was muchmore motivated in law school than I was in undergraduate, especially after taking a year off.Emory shapes and molds you into what you're going to be and part of that is from the great foundationyou get while you're at Emory. [You're able] to go through life and experience things and be able to figureout your way through them.
