"[She] would spend anhour or more on the phone with citizens, counseling them on what options they had to challenge actionstaken by their city council or city commission."Manis and Cohen co-authored a 1988 article for the Mercer Law Review, entitled "Georgia's OpenRecords and Open Meetings Laws: A Continued March Toward Government in the Sunshine," whichexplored the implications of the 1988 amendments to Georgia's "Sunshine Laws." Their article concludedthat the amendments would lead to greater government transparency."Nowadays we take for granted … laws on the books that protects citizens access to meetings andrecords of state and local agencies," Cohen said.
