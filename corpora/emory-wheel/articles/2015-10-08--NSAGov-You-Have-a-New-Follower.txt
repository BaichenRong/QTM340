Last week, Edward Snowden, controversial privacy activist and notorious government leaker,#BrokeTheInternet when he joined Twitter. In his first tweet, he asked, "Can you hear me now?"Beginning with this mocking reference to the series of mid-2000s Verizon commercials, he has sincereleased a series of tweets about government surveillance and accountability.His Twitter handle @Snowden quickly accumulated more than 1.3 million followers in three days. Whileso many follow him, he is only following one Twitter account —the National Security Agency (NSA), thegovernment agency that Snowden revealed in 2013 to be operating massive secret domestic andinternational surveillance programs.Joining Twitter has brought Snowden to the headlines recently, but this runs contrary to a larger trend ofhis revelations about the NSA fading from the American public consciousness. Maybe his new Twitteraccount will keep the ember of this important issue burning so that the American public cancomprehensively address its implications.Discussion of the scope of NSA surveillance has been conspicuously lacking from the presidentialcampaign circus.In the most recent Republican debate, many subjects were covered, ranging from the false (CarlyFiorina's comments about the Planned Parenthood video) to the farcical ("What woman would you put onthe $10 bill?" and more or less everything emitted from The Donald's mouth). Occasionally interspersedamongst the reality show of a debate, the prospective holders of the nation's nuclear codes (*shudder*)touched upon substantive policy issues.Yet, conspicuously lacking from the debate was any mention of Edward Snowden and the revelationsthat he leaked in 2013 about the NSA.This omission from the debate is part of a bipartisan movement in American politics to forget that theSnowden's revelations occurred and maintains the NSA's surveillance infrastructure.When Snowden first exposed that the NSA had been spying on the phone calls of tens of millions ofAmericans, obtaining personal information from Internet companies and spying on foreign governmentsin 2013, the information took the world by storm. His subsequent flight to Moscow, where he remains tothis day, gave the story an air of drama not often seen outside the movies.The Department of Justice subsequently charged Snowden with three felony charges that, if he isconvicted, could land him in prison for up to 30 years.Despite the gravity of Snowden's revelations and their former prominence, discussion of them has all butleft the public forum.The NSA's operations were last publicly discussed this past spring, when Obama reauthorizedcontroversial parts of the Patriot Act and placed restrictions on NSA spying.The passing of the USA Freedom Act overruled a May Court of Appeals Second Circuit decision rulingthat the NSA program was illegal.The USA Freedom Act essentially legitimized the NSA's previously secret and illegal operations. We willhave to wait on another court decision to see if the USA Freedom Act is illegal as well.The current crop of presidential candidates has scarcely discussed the issue. While the Republicans tryto say controversial things to get their voice heard over Trump, Clinton remains bogged down in apoliticized email scandal and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders discusses more socioeconomic issues,we are ignoring the greatest encroachment on our liberties in recent memory.In the first Republican debate over the summer, the NSA was only mentioned once in a spat betweenKentucky Senator Rand Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with Paul criticizing the NSA'sactivities and Christie supporting them.In the rare instances when the NSA comes up, most of the other presidential candidates — bothRepublican and Democrat — have stood behind the NSA's intrusive policies. Clinton endorsed the USAFreedom Act, but beyond that, has not said much about the NSA.Jeb Bush offered a rare endorsement of an Obama policy regarding the NSA: "I would say the best partof the Obama administration would be his continuance of the protections of the homeland using, youknow, the big metadata programs, the NSA being enhanced."Paul has been one of the most vocal supporters of reigning in the NSA. Last May, Paul staged a morethan 12-hour filibuster to publicize reforming the NSA during Senate debate over the USA Freedom Act.But it looks as if we may lose Paul's voice in the presidential discussion. The Kentucky senator is pollingat less than three percent nationally right now, a threshold too low to qualify for the next Republicandebate at the end of the month.Besides Paul, Sanders is the only other presidential candidate who is opposed to the USA Freedom Act.He has failed to emphasize it as an important issue, though.There is a legitimate debate about whether the NSA surveillance programs should persist. Advocates forthe surveillance say it keeps America safe; opponents call it a violation of fundamental constitutionalrights. There may not be a clear answer here. Maybe it does keep us safer while encroaching upon ourrights.Perhaps even more concerning is that the government hid these programs from us until Snowden hadthe courage to reveal them.Regardless of your position on the NSA surveillance, it is undeniable that it is one of the axial issues ofour time. If we do not adequately address the scope of government surveillance and the transparencywith which it is carried out, we risk allowing the country to descend down a dismal and possiblydystopian path.We must publicly discuss the scope of the NSA's activities, or, at the very least, follow @Snowden onTwitter.Ben Perlmutter is a College senior from Chappaqua, New York.
