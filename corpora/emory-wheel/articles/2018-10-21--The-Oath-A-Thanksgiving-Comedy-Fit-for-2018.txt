November isclosing in on us. Next month, thousands of Americans will travel home and feast on a dinner filled withroast turkey, mouth-watering mashed potatoes and warm pumpkin pie. Or, as writer and director IkeBarinholtz demonstrates in his directorial debut "The Oath," "the day of thanks" will consist of workingthrough — or more likely, fighting through — familial tensions. From Barinholtz, known for his work on"MADtv" and his supporting role on "The Mindy Project,comes a Thanksgiving thriller-comedy fit for2018. "The Oath" follows a hostile family Thanksgiving dinner, hosted by ultra-political news-junkie Chris(Ike Barinholtz) and his wife Kai (Tiffany Haddish), that quickly turns into a violent, chaotic event. Theconflict, set in an alternate, present-day United States, centers around a contentious loyalty oathmandated by the president for all citizens to sign, leading to massive divisions within the family. Althoughit is set in a dystopian America, "The Oathtakes influence from the current political climate of the UnitedStates and from President Donald J. Trump's administration. Members of the family represent the wholepolitical spectrum, mirroring each distinctive archetype of American political discourse. Chris's brother,Pat, played by Barinholtz's real-life brother Jon, and his girlfriend Abbie (Meredith Hagner), representTrump's radical right supporters, while Chris's parents Eleanor (Nora Dunn) and Hank (Chris Ellis) aremild, centrist conservatives of the likes of Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Chris' sister Alice (Carrie Brownstein)plays the role of the establishment liberal, while Chris and Kai represent the far left. The Oathfinds itsstrength in its political discourse. Most viewers will find similarities between their family and the film'scharacters. Its best scenes are around the dinner table, where Chris and his family members argue overdifferent issues, including signing an oath that declares their loyalty to the government. The most chillingscene occurs when the family goes out to eat and is interrupted by an outburst where a patron loudlydisparages other restaurant-goers for "hating America" and for dissenting against the government. Thefilm begins to lose its vision with the introduction of two agents (Billy Magnussen and John Cho) of theoppressive Citizen's Protection Unit (CPU), when they visit Chris's house after receiving a call about hisopposition to the government (the call was presumably made by someone in the house). The encounterquickly turns violent, with the agents accidentally knocked out cold. The rest of the film follows thefamily's attempt to solve the situation. While the violence, which makes up most of the second half of thefilm, produces some of the film's funnier moments, it often undermines the deeper message establishedat the beginning. The jokes become cheaper as the violence increases, and, by the final scenes, the filmfails to properly solve the deeper issues within the family. The ending utilizes the contrived plot device ofthe deus ex machina (an unexpected event that saves a seemingly irreparable situation). The endingdoes not do justice to the shrewd intricacies that Barinholtz develops in the first half of the film, leavingthe viewer unsatisfied. "The Oath" shows that when Americans go home to visit their families and eattheir warm pumpkin pies, they should, instead of preparing for attack, find a common ground with theirpolitically divided families. In 2018, political tensions are as high as ever and Barinholtz believes thatlistening, not fighting, will solve the deep partisan chasm. While imperfect, "The Oath" gets the politicalcomplexity of 2018 right and is particularly salient for voters before the November midterm elections. It isa positive start for Barinholtz and provides a sturdy foundation for his directorial career.Grade: BThe post 'The Oath' A Thanksgiving Comedy Fit for 2018 appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
