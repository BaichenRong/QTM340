For the past week, my social media feed has been full of memes, cartoons and essay-length postschastising Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden. Despite her young age,Thunberg has been widely influential in organizing global climate strikes like the one Emory studentsjoined on Sept. 20. With a Time magazine cover and several appearances at the United Nations alreadyunder her belt, Thunberg is well on her way to changing the world. Even her ideological foes can't stoptalking about her.Conservatives have pulled out all the stops to thwart Thunberg: accusations of childishness, mockery ofher autism spectrum disorder and comparisons to horror movie characters, to name a few. Many ofthose now taking personal shots at Thunberg were quick to defend the Covington Catholic teens fromonline harassment earlier this year. It seems that minors are fair game for personal attacks when youdisagree with their politics.Climate change deniers have clearly lost in the marketplace of ideas and are resorting to crude,immature character attacks. Thunberg echoes the scientific community's consensus on the issue anddemands action from world governments. Is the notion that politicians should craft policy in response toscientific data and public pressure really so outrageous?I don't care if it's Barron Trump, the Covington teens or Greta Thunberg. Let's all agree to stop harassingkids.Zach Ball (21C) is from Griffin, Ga.The post Stop Harassing Kids to Score Political Points appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
