"We were totallyexpecting that we would see a runoff because it's a three-person race with a no-confidence choice."Kidd wrote in an email to the Wheel that he is looking forward to the runoff, which will allow students todraw clear comparisons between candidates to cast an informed vote."Regardless of who wins, that public trust is what's most important, particularly given the turbulence ofthe last year," Kidd wrote.The election had several voting access issues during initial stages of voting, Cohen said. Somefreshmen were initially unable to vote, and for many students, Microsoft Outlook marked an emailcontaining the link to the online ballot as spam.Cohen said the Elections Board considered extending the voting period because of the voting issues butultimately decided against doing so.Some of the issues stemmed from SGA's update from OrgSync to a newer and untested voting system,Engage. Cohen said the Elections Board wasn't responsible for the decision to update.Freshmen who had not previously used OrgSync were initially unable to vote on the ballot throughEngage because their Emory network IDs and email addresses were not connected to the new platform,according to Cohen."Once we noticed that mistake, which was brought to our attention by three freshmen, we made acorrection," Cohen said. "Since then, all freshmen have been able to vote correctly."The email with the external link to the online ballot appeared on Outlook as spam. The Elections Boarddoes not know how many people received the email in their junk folder.The morning after the Elections Board sent the email, Cohen said he posted flyers around campus toinform students about the voting period. The flyers had a QR code containing the link to the ballot.On this year's ballots, voters self-selected their class to receive a ballot with the correct races.Previously, voters received a ballot that contained all of the elections they were eligible to vote in."There was a huge issue with students given ballots based on their year, but that year is based on credithours, not on their nominal grade," Cohen said. "We don't have any data to give ballots to the correctclasses. â€¦ The self-select page was the best option to make sure that voters are voting for theirrespective class."The post Palmer, Kidd Vie for SGA Presidency appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
