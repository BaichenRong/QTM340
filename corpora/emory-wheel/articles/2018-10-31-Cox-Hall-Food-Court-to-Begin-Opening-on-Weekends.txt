Cox Hall Food Court is scheduled to open on weekends between 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Nov. 10 to theend of the semester, as a pilot program, according to Director of Campus Dining Chad Sunstein.Cox Convenience Corner, Twisted Taco, Ray's New York Pizza, Maru and Freshens will participate inthe program, Sunstein said."We have received feedback from students through various channels that they would like to see CoxHall open during the weekends, and we thought testing this out during the rest of the Fall semester wouldbe a great start," Sunstein wrote in an Oct. 30 email to the Wheel.Emory Dining last modified Cox Hall's hours in August 2017 when it changed the weekday closing timefrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.Julia Zhong (21C) said Cox Hall's expanded hours are a positive change because there are limited oncampus dining options for students over the weekend. She said the option to eat at Cox Hall onweekends will be especially beneficial for upperclassmen who often have fewer DUC-ling meal swipesthan underclassmen.Charlie Scruton (21C) said he plans to take advantage of the weekend hours."I â€¦ would definitely use [Cox Hall] on the weekends," Scruton said. "I use [Cox Hall] quite often on theweekdays, and I think there is a shortage of food spots open on the weekends on campus."Correction (10/31/18 at 10:23 a.m.): This article has been updated to reflect that Cox Hall will beginopening on both Saturday and Sunday, not just Saturday.The post Cox Hall Food Court to Begin Opening on Weekends appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
