I remember thesadness, hurt and surprise when I was rejected from my top choice of schools after pouring over thoseapplications.I had almost forgotten these feelings of confusion, rejection and sadness, until I read an article by JoelStein in the Feb. 2, 2015 edition of TIME magazine. Stein is a graduate of Stanford University, who duringhis time as an undergraduate student, had been allowed to see the comments of the admissionscounselors on his application. His piece is about his experience with this and his desire to impart hiswords of wisdom on the new generation of Stanford students who were lobbying to be able to see thecomments on their applications. Stein was allowed to see his application because a friend of his used theFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act to convince Stanford to allow students to see theapplications, yet now he encourages this new generation of students to avoid looking at the commentson their applications.Initially, I was surprised that this man had elected to see the comments that admissions officers hadwritten on his application. This seemingly went against the very sacred agreement between admissionsofficer and applicant, the agreement that said the admissions officer could laugh at my application aslong as I didn’t have to witness it. I am under no impression that my application was given the carefulattention I had hoped for. This is nothing against the admissions offices of universities; they havethousands of applications to read and must send out decisions in a timely matter. They just simply can’tspend more than a few seconds on each application. However, after thinking about it, I have to say thatin the same position as Stein, I would also want to see the comments written on my application. I want tosee them, not because I need validation or a reason for why I wasn’t admitted. I want to look at thembecause it will hold colleges and universities accountable when they say that their admissions process ishonest and fair.There is a veil of secrecy surrounding college admissions, and I think students, both accepted andunaccepted, should be allowed to view the comments on their applications, or at the very least receive apersonalized explanation of the decision of the admissions board. Although this may seem timeconsuming on the part of the admissions officer, in reality they are already doing it, just not committing itto words. The explanation needn’t be long; a simple sentence would suffice, but it would force institutionsto provide a reason for rejecting specific candidates and accepting other equally, or sometimes less,qualified candidates in their place.Where this particular issue becomes unclear is the state-funded versus private institution. At a statefunded school, the percentage of accepted students is often higher than the percentage of studentsaccepted to many private institutions. This is due to the state funding provided and the regulations thatcome with receiving that money.One way of looking at this issue is that state-funded schools should be required to allow students to seecomments on their applications because they are large institutions receiving federal aid, and in the UnitedStates people expect oversight for institutions receiving federal money, their tax dollars. This particularview of the application question is derived from the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act thatStein’s friend used to force Stanford to show them their applications.This situation is often seen as being dramatically different from that of the private institution. On thewhole, it can be generalized that private institutions tend to be more selective in that they accept a lowerpercentage of their applicants in part because they don’t receive federal supplements. Many areattracted to a private college because of their perceived selectivity. Some say that these institutionsshould not be required to allow students to view their applications — an argument that I also understand,but with which I don’t agree. I think private colleges should allow students to view comments about theirapplications, only because of the growing emphasis placed by these institutions on integrity.By allowing students to see the comments on their applications, institutions would show a dedication tothe student and allow the world to see that their admissions decisions are as fair as possible. An articlepublished in Forbes Magazine and written by Steve Cohen details the three biggest lies told in collegeadmissions and by those who are involved in the process.The first is that standardized tests are becoming less important. Often college admissions officers willsay that standardized tests are not the only factors looked at for admission. However, they areimportant, as many selective schools use them to filter out applicants due to the high number ofapplications they receive. In this way, a high standardized test score is important for your application tomake it past the first round of cuts and could therefore be seen as the most important part of theapplication. The issue isn’t that these tests scores are important for admission; it is that admissionsoffices make it seem as though they aren’t as important as one’s grade-point average, which isn’t thecase in many initial application decisions. The second lie is that applying for financial aid does not affectthe results of the decision. Cohen argues that in times of economic downturn, colleges can’t afford to becompletely need-blind during admissions.“If there is a choice between two virtually-identical applicants — one who needs financial aid and onewho does not — the fat envelope is going to go to the kid who can pay full tuition,” according to Cohen,even if the college claims to be need-blind to its applicants. Finally, Cohen points out that the biggest lie incollege admissions is that the process is fair. While he details many unfair variables, the one I find mostfault with is that academic institutions are looking for “a well-rounded class, not a well-rounded kid.”Although the common advice is that students should be well-rounded, the truth is that an applicant who isspectacular in one particular area contributes to a well-rounded class more so than an applicant whohimself is well-rounded but not particularly strong in one area. This goes against much of the advice fromadmissions counselors to be involved in a wide variety of activities outside of academics.While these problems can’t be resolved overnight, or by simply allowing students to see the commentson their applications, they can be made more public. Students who see comments about theirstandardized test scores, their financial aid application and how well-rounded they are on their applicationwill have a better understanding of the admissions process and decision. This understanding can then bepassed on to others, making the overall process more open and honest in terms of what colleges areactually looking for.Allowing students to see the comments on their applications isn’t so much about the students as it isabout the institution. I am sure that the college admissions process isn’t fair, and I have accepted it aspart of my life as a student who attends college. However, allowing students to see the comments ontheir applications forces the institution to either remedy its admissions process to fit its stated goals offairness and honesty, or to admit that its application process is flawed at best and completely dishonestat worst, something most students know already but would still like the universities to recognize. Thediscrepancy between how the application process is presented and how admissions actually works isdisheartening to students, and if they can access the currently hidden parts of the process then they canaccept the system, even if it is flawed. Most applicants know that the admissions process is unfair, yetwe continue to apply anyway. Allowing us to see the comments on our applications will not deterapplicants but will instead provide a model of openness that many institutions reciprocally claim to desirein their graduates.A college or university cannot have a secret and dishonest admissions process and expect its graduatesto be open and honest. In my opinion, if an institution truly wants graduates who represent the conceptsof integrity and honesty, then the admissions process must be opened up, and the first step is allowingthe comments on applications to be viewed by the applicant.Alli Buettner is a College sophomore from St. Louis, Missouri.
