A former Emory graduate student is on cleanup duty for a major American environmental and publichealth crisis.Chris Kolb, executive director of the Michigan Environmental Council, was one of 19 law, environmentalscience and policy experts appointed to the Environmental Justice Work Group, which Michigan Gov.Rick Snyder created last week to develop materials on environmental and health hazards for thegovernment following the Flint, Mich., water crisis.Snyder's creation of the Environmental Justice Work Group came amidst the city's recovery from ayears-long crisis in which Flint residents' drinking water was contaminated with lead. He created thegroup in response to recommendations from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which hecommissioned October 2015 to investigate the phenomena. The new group will examine policy issuesand develop guidance, training and curriculum on environmental and health hazards to supportgovernment officials, according to a Feb. 15 press release from Snyder's office.Kolb, who will co-chair the new work group, pursued graduate studies in political science at LaneyGraduate School for one year — but then took a job in the environmental management field instead ofcompleting his Ph.D.During his time at Laney, Kolb conducted research on interest group politics at the Supreme Court."Knowing the power that research can do to further your goals is really important," Kolb said. "It wasmore of the tools and the discipline to apply research in a way that makes a difference."Kolb said that in order to recover from the Flint crisis and achieve "environmental justice," Michiganought to implement non-discriminatory environmental regulations and collect input from the public duringthe legislation process. The new work group has not met yet, and Kolb said he does not know when itsfirst meeting will occur.As co-chair of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, Kolb and his team recommended a mandate ofenvironmental protection guidance and training across all state agencies to standardize assessmentprotocol during disasters. The team's findings also suggested that industrial areas weredisproportionately burdened with pollution, a disparity that Kolb said he aims to address through theEnvironmental Justice Work Group.According to the Flint Water Advisory Task Force report, Flint failed to uphold two major principles ofenvironmental justice — treating all people fairly through non-discriminatory practices and involving thepublic in decision-making. To prevent another drinking-water crisis like that in Flint from occurring, Kolbemphasized the need to alter environmental regulations to ensure better public feedback andgovernment transparency. The task force's report praised citizens' willingness to challenge andparticipate in the government, and Kolb said he hopes for similar community involvement in futuredecision-making.
