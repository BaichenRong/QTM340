It is true that I haveencountered numerous people who are prepared to attack or defend with a dogmatic fervor the value ofwhatever vague concept lies behind this name, but I have yet to meet anybody who has given me aproper explanation as to what the liberal arts actually are. In this article, I am concerned with giving anaccount as to what I believe the “liberal arts” constitute, in an attempt to facilitate productive discussionon this topic in the future.I will begin by attempting to define the term negatively – that is, in terms of what it is not – for I have foundmost positive definitions are intolerably vague. People are likely to praise the liberal arts on the groundsthat it creates “active” and “responsible-minded citizens,” that it prepares students to be the “intellectualleaders of America” and so on, but in so doing, these people have only given what they believe theeffects of a liberal arts education are and not what a liberal arts education itself actually is. I have found,however, that people describe liberal arts education much clearer when asked to contrast it against, forinstance, pre-professional education.The ends of the pre-professional education are clear enough. They aim at preparing the individual toexcel at some narrowly defined craft, as law school attempts to make good lawyers, culinary schoolgood chefs, medical school good doctors and so on. By a similar methodology, we may initially be eagerto ask ourselves what craft the liberal arts aim to cultivate, but we would find ourselves sorelydisappointed in that regard, since the “liberal arts” encompass such a wide variety of fields that it wouldbe futile in this manner to find a narrowly-defined animating principle that binds them all together.The wide scope of the liberal arts, no doubt, is the reason why both proponents and critics of it have hadsuch difficulty debating its value or lack thereof. Therefore, what I would like to do is, in the first place,divide the liberal arts into two classifications, those of the practical arts and those of the theoretical arts.The division between the practical arts and the theoretical arts may very broadly be thought of withrespect to current divisions between the humanities and the natural sciences, but even these divisionsare not so clear-cut, as we soon shall see.It is unfortunate that the word “practical” is host to a whole slew of ambiguities. In one sense, forinstance, the craft (e.g. cooking, doctoring, etc.) is called practical, because it aims at affecting somespecific external end. I, however, wish to distance myself from the practical in the sense of a craft infavor of a definition of “practical” that aims at good human activity as taken as a whole. In this sense, theend of the practical arts aims at the exercise of ethical action and the development of moral character.This open definition further complicates the end of the practical arts as opposed to the end of crafts,however, for it is much easier to determine what makes a good lawyer, chef or doctor than it is todetermine who is to be considered an ethically good person.On account of this difficulty, it is clear that the practical arts to some extent also aim at developing theknowledge of its own aims, if you will permit me the use of this infelicitous phrase. That is, the practicalarts aim not only at the development of good character in itself, but additionally at the development of thepractical wisdom needed to understand by what activities and in what manner a good character isachievable. Examples of the practical arts may therefore include history, psychology and politicalscience, for history allows us to obtain practical wisdom from the mistakes and successes of ourforebears, psychology allows us to understand the individual motivation of human actors, politicalscience enables us to understand these motivations and their consequent activities taken as anaggregate.The “theoretical arts” may best be defined as those arts that do not aim at anything inherently usefuloutside of themselves but are nevertheless felt to be intrinsically valuable, possibly because they fulfillthe innate human need of understanding something for its own sake. The Greek philosophers have longsince held that the minds of human beings are two-fold: one half of it, they alleged to be worldly, and theother they alleged to be divine. As opposed to the “practical arts,” which we have said aim at thedevelopment of the “worldly part” of the human soul, the “theoretical arts” are concerned with theexercise of the “divine part” of the human mind and with sating our natural sense of curiosity that first ledus to steal fire from the Gods. It is this part of our soul that aims at finding absolute truths and atestablishing the stable underlying first principles of the world of beings; through the cultivation of thedivine part of the soul, we come closest to unfolding the coiled “account”(&lambda;ό&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;) that underlies all the universe. Examples of the theoretical artstherefore include: mathematics, physics, theology – for mathematics aim at the abstracted first principlesof the forms themselves of knowledge, physics aims at the underlying determining principles of the worldof appearances, theology aims at the confrontation of the Absolute Being whence we dimly feel allentities and their modalities emanate.Yet it is clear that not everybody who studies physics is studying it qua theoretical, nor everybody whostudies history studying it qua practical. Most medical students, for example, study physics in thecapacity of a craft useful to them only insofar as it allows them to practice the craft of medicine.Likewise, the graduate student of history may incidentally study history qua practical (insofar as hebelieves that in studying it, he necessarily develops his sense of ethical character), but the graduatestudent is primarily studying it qua craft, because he hopes to do well enough in history so as to build theskill-set necessary for the sake of doing academic work. It is clear, then, that the liberal arts are notliberal arts only as a result of the objects of the field of knowledge with which they purport to deal, butthey are liberal arts also in respect to the motivations of the subject who studies them. The liberal artsare most perfected in the subject who studies both forms of them for their proper purposes — thedevelopment of both ethical action and the contemplation of the first principles — and for no other reasonsave for the purpose of cultivating these two ends, except incidentally. In studying the liberal arts, theindividual therefore cultivates themself to the fullest of their potential as a human being, for such anindividual exerts themself to the greatest possible extent in accordance with the excellences of bothparts of the human soul.The act from which I have hitherto refrained is that of positing an answer to the controversial question ofwhich form of education is “better,” the “pre-professional education” or the “liberal arts education.” Myanswer to this difficult question no doubt requires further thought, but it is clear that both of them arerequired for the full functioning of the individual in the context of a society, for while the “liberal arts” thusdescribed have only concerned themselves with developing the individual as an individual, the “preprofessional education” concerns itself with developing the individual as a productive member of society.These two forms of education are therefore co-dependent in some way, for a functioning human societyis necessary for the full exercise of the practical arts (since the “human is by nature a political animal”),and, to some extent, we are also disposed to consider people, who are in general good and virtuouspeople, better at their respective crafts. But let this further division of the forms of human education beput off for a different time. As to what the liberal arts are, and as to why they are valuable, I believe thatmy account, as it currently stands, is no less obscure than any other.
