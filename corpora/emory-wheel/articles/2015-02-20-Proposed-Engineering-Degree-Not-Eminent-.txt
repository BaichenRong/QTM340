The College Curriculum Committee approved the proposal for a Bachelors of Science Degree inEngineering Sciences for undergraduate students on Feb. 9. The program, if approved by the UniversitySubstantive Change Review Committee, would allow students to choose from three concentrationsdesigned to be interdisciplinary by nature.We at the Wheel feel that the establishment of a major in a field which Emory University has no history ofeminence strays from the vision used to justify the Fall 2012 departmental changes enacted by DeanRobin Forman, including the closing of the Journalism program, the Division of Educational Studies andthe Visual Arts department, among others. While the proposal has yet to receive final approval, we don’tunderstand how this program contributes to the goal of preserving and strengthening the University’smost eminent departments and parting from more “pre-professional” degrees in favor of the liberal artsexperience.We support Emory’s attempt to improve its reputation and competitiveness among peer institutions byestablishing new degree programs. However, we are concerned that this proposal, which seeks to addonly one new class, Fundamentals of Engineering (PHYS 222), and a combination of already existingcourses to what was previously an Applied Physics major, does not establish a program of considerableacademic eminence.In our view, it merely slaps the buzzword “engineering” onto a physics program already in place and willfail to provide the skills necessary to merit its new label. We realize that this program was not intended tocompete with the dual-degree program with Georgia Tech, but we feel that the word “engineering” in agraduate’s field of study is less valuable than experience in drafting, design and software like AutoCAD,among other specific subject areas. If the motivation for creating this major is to make it easier forstudents to be accepted to graduate engineering programs, a benefit emphasized by some proponents ofthe program, we do not understand how this is compatible with Forman’s labeling several of theprograms discontinued in 2012 as “too pre-professional.”We believe that the current dual-degree program offers a highly valuable academic opportunity, as itallows students to graduate with degrees from both liberal arts and an engineering-focused institutionsand, most often, get a well-paying job immediately after graduation. The fact that students in the Collegehad in part suggested the Engineering Sciences major proposal demonstrates a clear desire for theseskill sets that is not satisfied by the dual-degree program, and may help students who are not acceptedto the dual-degree program and wish to study engineering in graduate school.If it is the College’s intent to provide students with the opportunity to further their intents in engineeringwithout narrowing their options down to the dual-degree program, we hope that this proposal is the first ina series of steps to establish the goal of “eminence” used to justify the 2012 changes. Though we believeUniversity funds could be more usefully allocated to a multitude of other purposes, such as need-basedfinancial aid awards, the program should be further developed if it is indeed “eminence” that we areworking toward.If aggrandizing the program is not a long term goal, we believe the University should hesitate at the veryleast to create a major that is essentially a crossword puzzle of other programs under the coveted brandof “engineering.” It could threaten the Emory’s target of pursuing eminence in a set of specific butprestigious areas, such as Business and Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology, and detract from thegoal of avoiding “pre-professional” degrees.The above staff editorial represents the majority opinion of the Wheel ‘s editorial board.
