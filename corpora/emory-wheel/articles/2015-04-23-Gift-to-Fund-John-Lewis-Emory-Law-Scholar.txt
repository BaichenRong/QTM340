He added that the Schoolwill begin the national search for a professor this summer, focusing on a scholar who will become anEmory professor focused on research and teaching in the area of civil rights and social justice.Joella Hricik, associate dean for development and alumni relations for the School, said this is one of themost significant gifts the School has received.She added that the anonymous donor believes that Lewis — who has served in Congress for threedecades from 1986 till today, is a co-founder of the civil rights group Student Nonviolent CoordinatingCommittee (SNCC) and is the only surviving speaker of the 1963 March on Washington — holds acentral place in Atlanta’s civil rights legacy.“As we’ve recently marked the 50th anniversary of several milestones of the civil rights struggle, itseems especially fitting to honor a living icon of the movement who has continued to fight for civil rightsand social justice throughout his entire life and career,” the donor said. “We hope that a professorship atEmory Law School in his name will in some small way help to continue the good and great work that hehas done these last 50 years.”Dorothy Brown, a professor of law at the Law School, who teaches a seminar about race theory and whowill be co-facilitating this fall’s University course “The Ferguson Movement,” called the establishment ofthe new chair an opportunity to solidify Emory’s ties to Atlanta and “carry the baton forward.”“I think that the Law School has a rich history [of championing civil rights],” she said. “I think this bringsthat history forward to the 21st century … I see this as building upon what we have before, but basicallya new chapter. We are turning the page here in a phenomenal way.”Along with the 1962 lawsuit, Schapiro said the Law School exemplifies a commitment to diversity in otherways, such as the C. Robert Henrikson Endowed Scholarship Fund to support, to attract and retainstudents from diverse backgrounds, a partnership with the undergraduate law journal at MorehouseCollege and Spelman College and a visiting day program that targets underrepresented groups.“Having a faculty professorship named after Congressman Lewis will be a very visible reminder of theLaw School’s commitment to diversity and will help advance our scholarly and teaching mission in areasof civil rights and social justice,” Schapiro said. “So it is quite special to be able to combine our interestsin research and faculty of great academic distinction with this ongoing commitment to diversity andinclusion.”Others outside the School hope to gain from this opportunity as well. Interim Chair of the Department ofAfrican American Studies Andra Gillespie, for example, said she sees many synergies between this newposition and her department.“There are all kinds of possibilities and ways that [the new chair] could get involved with the life of theUniversity that actually transcends their appointment in the Law School,” she said. “So we hope thatwhoever they choose will be the type of person who would actually be willing to engage scholars acrossall kinds of interdisciplinary fields.”Lewis told Creative Loafing that he would like the scholar to research issues such as police brutalityagainst unarmed African American people.“Maybe someone can conduct a study on the violence,” Lewis told Creative Loafing. “We’re losing toomany people to gun violence in communities on the part of law enforcement. It’s frightening tocontemplate about what’s happening in so many urban centers all around America. Maybe Emory andother institutions, lawyers and scholars, can find out why so many men of color are becoming to victimsto law enforcement.”University President James W. Wagner told the Emory News Center that Lewis has “exemplifiedprofound understanding of the moral imperative of justice,” according to an April 20 University pressrelease.“Emory University is deeply honored that the congressman has allowed us to recognize his contributionsto American social justice through the naming of this professorship,” Wagner said in the press release.“The John Lewis Professorship will both honor a great American and remind future Emory-educatedattorneys of the responsibility bequeathed to them as servants of the law.”Lewis spoke at Emory’s commencement address in 2014, where Emory also honored him with anHonorary Doctor of Laws degree.– By Karishma Mehrotra
