Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) hired three mental health counselors at the beginning ofthe semester and will take interviews for two more over the next two months, according to AssistantVice President of Campus Life and CAPS Director Wanda Collins.The five additional hires will bump the number of CAPS clinical services staff to 19.Collins said the University approved the additional hires during the summer to meet increased demandfor clinical services from students. Over the past five years, the number of students attending CAPSclinical services has increased by 60 percent, according to Collins.Anna McDonough (21C), president of Emory's Active Minds chapter, an organization which works toraise awareness about mental health on college campuses, called the new CAPS hires a positive step inaddressing student mental health."One of the biggest pieces of feedback I get through my affiliation with Active Minds is that the wait timeto see counselors is way too long," McDonough said. "This is their way to try and decrease that."Collins also said CAPS is piloting an increasingly popular program called "Let's Talk" at the EmorySchool of Law. The program began at Cornell University (N.Y.) in 2008 and allows students to meet withavailable counselors for brief walk-in sessions once a week."Students can stop by for a consultation and talk about things that are bothering them and try anddetermine next steps," Collins said. "It's really a way to try and be more accessible to students and helpthem figure out what kinds of support they might need."CAPS plans to expand the program to the Laney Graduate School and is open to expanding the programto include undergraduate students based on need, Collins said.Collins emphasized that CAPS also helps communities through efforts beyond clinical services, such astraining for residence life staff, community outreach and advising for student groups."When I think about mental health, it's actually much broader than staff," Collins said. "It includes theOffice of Health Promotion, Student Health Services — where psychiatry is located — the Office ofStudent Success programs, and also other student organizations like our Active Minds chapter orHelpline … and different identity centers."Correction (9/11/2019 at 1:54 p.m.): A previous version of this article stated that CAPS would hire twoadditional counselors in the next two months. In fact, CAPS will take interviews for the two positions overthe next two months.The post CAPS to Hire 5 Additional Mental Health Counselors appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
