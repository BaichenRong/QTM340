Growing up, I rarely saw representations of queer black men onscreen. Further, I seldom, if ever, saweager audiences waiting to listen to or watch stories about these men's experiences. Thus, amid thenecessary conversations about increased, humanizing media representation — of people of color,members of the LGBTQ community, women and other historically marginalized individuals — I waseager to celebrate "Green Book." But "Green Book" should not be praised by the Academy just becauseof its potential for greatness; it should be critiqued for its ineffective delivery.Based on a true story, "Green Book" is a dramedy about a friendship that develops between Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali), a queer black concert pianist, and Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), a bigotedItalian-American ball buster. Set in 1962, Shirley hires Vallelonga as his driver in the deep South andMidwest. The film explores the racial tensions between Shirley and Vallelonga, the internal prejudiceVallelonga learns to reject and Shirley's experiences in the South.However, the film has received significant and deserved backlash in light of its recent Oscar win for bestpicture, due to its rigid portrayal of Shirley and Vallelonga's friendship, minimal exploration of Shirley'ssexuality, Mortensen's use of the N-word during a press event and the exclusion of Shirley's family asconsultants during the filmmaking process.I attended the film's world premiere this fall at the Toronto International Film Festival and positivelyreviewed the film for the Wheel. I was excited to see hundreds of enthusiastic white faces in theaudience watch Shirley's story — I had not previously seen white exuberance during a film about race.I thought the juxtaposition between white audience members in Georgia and in Canada was aboutCanada's comparatively inclusive culture or geographic degrees of separation. Maybe people were morereceptive to a scathing critique of racism and homophobia in Toronto. But "Green Book" is not a scathingcritique of racism or homophobia. It is a romanticized film adaptation of an interracial friendship thatallows white audiences to superimpose themselves onto the figure of a rambunctious and loveable, albeitignorant, Italian fella.New York Times critic-at-large Wesley Morris refers to films like "Green Book" as "racial reconciliationfantasies." These films take incendiary, complicated issues and use the struggles of black characters tohelp white characters — and white audiences — feel better about America's racist past and present.Morris cites "The Help" and the 1990's Best Picture win, "Driving Miss Daisy" as notable examples.I am not arguing that films about race need to make audiences uncomfortable in order to be effective.Nor do underrepresented characters have to be the leads of every film in which they appear. Rather,underrepresented people deserve to exist on screen and in everyday life as more than teaching tools fortheir antagonizers, no matter how well-intentioned those antagonizers are.Having the supportive white peer be the protagonist of "Green Book" forces the threatened black man toact as a foil. Therefore, audiences only indirectly and intermittently interact with Shirley's ostracizationfrom society. Tense moments of bigotry and racism are posed as forgivable, because Vallelonga isn't asbad as other more blatantly racist whites. In these scenes, the film fails to do something critical. Not onlyshould Shirley — as Morris also argues — have been the champion and protagonist of this film, "GreenBook" should not have aimed to redeem Vallelonga through humor or good intentions. Let him fail; let himbe ugly. By asking the audience to forgive Vallelonga's shortcomings, viewers are not doing theimportant work of trying to recognize themselves in the bigot onscreen.That's why "Green Book" didn't deserve the award for Best Picture at the 76th Golden Globes, nor the91st Academy Awards. Nor did it deserve the 2018 TIFF People's Choice Award over "Roma," "TheHate U Give" or "Monsters & Men."In the months since watching and reviewing the film, I internalized the fact that adapting a film about thelife of a gay black man is not a laudable feat. Moving from no representation to minimal, botchedrepresentation may feel like an improvement. But this is merely an inventive way to commodify thehumanity of people who were simply typecast or entirely absent in films before.We cannot reward films that exploit the experiences of the oppressed as gratification tools for whitescene partners and audiences. When we do, we implicitly assert that stories about the oppressed are notas important as mainstream white audiences' efforts to care about them. If we are truly going to pushstudio executives, producers, writers and actors to prioritize projects that better represent modernAmerica, we must think critically about how willing we are to confront that America onscreen. Finally,critics like myself need to do better than to applaud a film for reaching for excellence. We need toapplaud them once, and if, they actually achieve excellence.Adesola Thomas (20C) is from Hampton, Ga.The post 'Green Book' Exploits Diversity for White Audiences appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
