The Emory Student Center (ESC) is the first Emory building to receive the Leadership in Energy andEnvironmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, according to Matthew Early, the outgoing vicepresident of campus services.Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the LEED program determines buildings'environmental footprints by rating their design, construction and operations. A building receives Platinumcertification if it scores over 80 of 100 possible credit points."LEED Platinum is as difficult [to obtain] as it is for someone to get a perfect score on the SAT," Earlysaid.The University submitted a scoresheet to the USGBC with the aid of a third-party firm that evaluated theESC's scores in categories such as rainwater management, optimization of energy usage and lightpollution reduction.However, Early emphasized the ESC's sustainability and reduction in energy use, rather than its LEEDPlatinum rating, as its greatest achievement."LEED Platinum is not your success story. Your real success story is how you reduce energy, how youmake it sustainable," Early said. "Even if you do not get a plaque that says LEED Platinum, your goal isstriving to reduce the energy use intensity, [reduce] water use [and] make sure you are sustainable withyour waste, that you are promoting sustainable processes."Early said that the ESC was one of the first buildings designed after the University's switch to moresustainable construction and planning processes.The building uses Emory's first geothermal system for air conditioning and uses reclaimed water fromEmory's water recycling system, WaterHub, for piping systems. Solar panels on the roof provide heat forthe building, which also features occupancy sensors to minimize the usage of electricity from lightfixtures.Early reported that the center boasts one of the lowest energy footprints of all Emory buildings.The University worked with Atlanta-based design firm Pattern r+d to achieve the ESC's smaller energyfootprint. The firm also considered other factors, such as plug load — the number of electronic devicesplugged in at the building — and the building's orientation, to further minimize its environmental footprint.Early said that every Emory building designed after the ESC uses the detailed metrics, such as plugload, to minimize environmental impact. The new Health Sciences Research Building (HSRB), which isundergoing preparations for construction, will follow the same sustainable construction model."When it's complete, [the HSRB] will probably be the lowest energy use research building in the nation,"Early said.The post ESC Becomes First LEED Platinum Certified Building at Emory appeared first on The EmoryWheel.
