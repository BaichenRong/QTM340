This conference brought together 12 speakers toshare their stories with hundreds of audience members in the auditorium.At TEDx events, either TED Talks videos are screened alone or in combination with live presenters withthe intent to spark deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned andcoordinated independently under a free license granted by TED.Keys to a Successful TEDx eventAccording to TEDxEmory staff members, the key to holding a TEDx event capable of drawing a largeaudience is to create a continually growing network of speakers who will accumulate incrementallythrough every event held."We reached out to some speakers by contacting the five academic advisors for TEDxEmory andconnected with other speakers through personal connections," College junior Maggie Cherneff said.Another key factor for a successful TEDx event is the attainment of sufficient funding, which, in thiscase, came from 12 Emory organizations and local businesses with whom TEDxEmory has cultivated asustaining and supportive relationship such as the Office of the President, the Emory StudentGovernment Association, Emory Alumni Association and Kaldi's Coffee to name a few."We've established a solid foundation of sponsors throughout the past six years, because TEDxEmorycan attract a large audience," College junior and programming member at TEDxEmory Kavina Jani said.According to Jani, settling on an interesting theme for the TEDx event also contributes to its success, butthe process requires both time and creative ideas from the TEDxEmory team."The reason why we picked 'Beauty of Things Unseen' as the theme is because we wanted to create acontext of thoughts that is open enough for people to craft their own understanding, but at the same time,targeted enough for people to think within the concept of hidden beauty," Jani said.The 12 speakers offered a feast of ideas on the topic of the beauty of things that people may not noticedaily. The event was broken down into four different sessions, each in which three speakers, who shareda common approach to the material, presented their own thoughts. These topics ranged from the impactof music in daily life to the empowering experience as a woman in the high-tech field.A compilation of inspiring talksNPR Host and Master of Ceremonies Rickey Bevington opened the talks by explaining the theme andher response to it.

Jones Memorial Trust (Bobby Jones) ScholarBertulis-Fernandes shared how he overcame his stutter and the importance of standing outside of thecomfort zone.

At the end of his talk, Fowler invited the audience tocreate music for themselves — to become the composers of the soundtracks of their own lives.Eddy Von Mueller, film and media studies senior lecturerMueller engaged the audience with his opening question: what makes people respond to images the waythey do? "Looking at pictures is different from seeing the world, as the way we perceive the imagesinvolves different perceptions," Mueller said. He went on to explain that "photography is a mechanicalrather than biological experience," as it acts as a sort of "truth-telling machine." He ended with a reflectionon how violence in American culture is reflected in Hollywood films.Kim Cobb, Georgia Tech professorCobb shared the findings of her research which uses corals and cave stalagmites to probe themechanisms of climate change. Her inspiring talk first pushed the audience to think intensely on therapid change in climate, as massive corals die because of the rise in carbon concentrations in water.After the audience raised their hands in response to Cobb question — whether they felt disappointment,anger or powerlessness with regards to on-going climate change — she sought to empower everyone inthe auditorium with the challenge to lower one's carbon footprint in daily life. "Let's not wait for thetechnical fix and the next president and Congress," Cobb said. "Let's take actions today."All the speakers, though they varied in terms of their professions and their presentation of the beautyunseen, engaged the audience with their empowering talks and sought to inspire people to pay moreattention to the little things in life.
