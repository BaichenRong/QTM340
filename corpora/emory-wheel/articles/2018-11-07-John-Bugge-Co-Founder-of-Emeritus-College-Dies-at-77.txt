Bugge was involved with Theater Emory and performed in someproductions with the group, including "The Cherry Orchard" in 2013. During the British Studies studyabroad program in the U.K. that he directed during the summers, Bugge organized faculty and studentactors to put on an opening dramatic presentation about Oxford University (England), Cavanagh said."His acting skills and ability really played into why he was such a talented teacher because he couldreally bring things to life," Cavanagh said. "He was very enthusiastic about the literature he was teachingand was very engaged with the students."Whether he was interacting with students or other professors, Bugge "valued the University" and enjoyedbeing a member of the Emory community, Emeritus College Director Gray Crouse said."He was so invested in being a faculty member at Emory that, as he saw himself retiring at some point,he didn't want that retirement to mean that he was basically saying goodbye to the University," Crousesaid.Bugge "gave himself to Emory," Morey said, adding that Bugge never sought the spotlight, but he was an"ever-present, behind-the-scenes" person who was "essential."Morey added that he appreciated Bugge's mentorship of himself and other junior faculty.Bugge mastered "terrific pronunciation" of Middle English, and, when he taught, it seemed like he hadsprinkled "magic dust" over his classroom, Morey said.Bugge is survived by his wife Liza Davis and sons Stefan Bugge (14C) and Eric Emmons (95C).
