The Emory Wheel's Endorsement Committee was made up of 12 members of the Editorial Board. Theyconducted individual interviews with the candidates and coordinated the Wheel Debates. Allendorsements/no confidence decisions were made based on the opinion of at least 80 percent of theCommittee. The members of the Committee were: Zak Hudak, Julia Munslow, Elana Cates, SamBudnyk, Hagar Elsayed, Alisha Compton, Hannah Conway, Ruth Reyes, Avery Yang, Michelle Lou,Benazir Wehelie and Dustin Slade.Our Pick: Max ZobermanThe Wheel's Endorsement Committee unanimously endorses College junior Max Zoberman for StudentGovernment Association (SGA) President. His combination of experience within the organization and ademonstrated ability to plan concrete initiatives make him the only qualified candidate.Zoberman, who is currently SGA executive vice president, has in his presidential platform highlighted thephysical and mental safety of students at Emory as "the single most important prerequisite for aneffective university." This is an overarching goal with which the Committee wholeheartedly agrees.Zoberman took a strong stance in his platform, writing that, "Emory can and should be the first universityin the country to be able to say that we are free of the specter of sexual violence on our campus." He hasactively pursued this goal, he said in his Committee interview, through communication withrepresentatives from the White House representatives regarding the prospect of making Emory anofficial partner with the "It's On Us" campaign.We do, however, feel some unease toward Zoberman's undeniable status as a politician — he told usthat his campaign team was made up of 20 students. Despite this, we cannot fault a candidate for takinghis or her job too seriously. After all, we should and do ask for our student leaders to be fully committedto their roles. Zoberman told us both that he has learned the importance of prioritizing his duties duringhis time as SGA EVP, and that he has planned his senior year schedule in a way that he would be ablemake his duties as president paramount.While Zoberman consistently uses buzz words such as "transparency" and "equity" in his platform,during his interview with the Wheel and at the Wheel Debates, he offered concrete means by which tomove towards a more transparent SGA and a more comfortable and represented community.For instance, Zoberman has visited the Oxford campus nearly weekly since being elected SGA EVP,creating a point of contact through which cross-campus programming has been made possible, he said.Additionally, he has taken transparency initiatives within SGA a step further, already having begun towork towards a third-party polling organization that would in theory create a more stable system ofchecks and balances between students and their governing body.Zoberman's opposition, Business School sophomore Daniel Rodriguez, who has no prior experience onSGA, is running largely on a platform of finding ways to bring various campus cultural groups together.Although the Committee values the ability of newcomers to run for positions within student government,we acknowledge that SGA initiatives can take as long as three years to pass; the recently implementedupfront budgeting system for student organizations, for instance, has been in the works since the 48thSGA, two years ago. In the Committee's interview with Rodriguez, it was clear that he had not yet found,let alone analyzed, the recent workings of SGA outside of his own discontent toward the organization'saccomplishments.We place unequaled importance on freedom of speech and were concerned with Zoberman's proposedresolution last year to fully ban Yik Yak from Emory's Wi-Fi, a position for which he was vehementlyattacked at the time. However, when asked if he would make a similar push as SGA president,Zoberman credited the experience as one of the most important of his SGA career: "I learned a hardlesson … to affect positive change, you need to aggravate interest first."For the aforementioned reasons, the Committee has decided that Zoberman is not only the mostqualified candidate for SGA president, he is the only qualified candidate.Our Pick: Gurbani SinghThe Wheel's Endorsement Committee unanimously endorses College sophomore Gurbani Singh forSGA executive vice president because of her demonstrated commitment, qualifications, enthusiasm andcharisma.In her two years in SGA, Singh has developed strong relationships with other members that will help heraccomplish SGA's goals and initiatives. She has also developed a particularly important relationship withSGA presidential candidate Max Zoberman, of whom the Committee also unanimously supports.Zoberman and Singh have similar objectives and, if both elected, could work together to see theirinitiatives through.As SGA's first-year representative last year and as a representative-at-large this year, Singh has thenecessary experience to serve as SGA EVP. She understands what is required of the organization'sEVP, and this furthers our expectations of cooperation between her and the rest of SGA. As traditionshows, the SGA executive vice presidency often goes hand-in-hand with the presidency the followingyear.Singh's platform outlines the main issues she would like to establish: transparency, inclusion, safety andtransportation, academics and dining. Transparency has historically been an issue for SGA, as theorganization has struggled to remain on the same page as the students it represents. We applaud Singhfor her dedication to opening the conversation between SGA and students with initiatives such aspromoting the fact that the organization's meetings are open to all students.Singh also emphasized the need for inclusion, and plans to continue meeting with the diverseorganizations on Emory's campus, such as the Black Student Alliance (BSA), Indian Cultural Exchange(ICE), Latino Student Organization (LSO) and the transgender community in order to create a saferenvironment for everyone. We agree with Singh that safety on campus is a top priority, and recognizeher enthusiasm to expand the SafeRide program and fully implement a "Buddy Walkers" system, inwhich students would be trained and paid through work study to walk fellow students to places whenthey feel unsafe.Singh agrees with Zoberman on the need to extend the duration of the Add/Drop/Swap period and ofreading periods before exams, and ensures this would be a primary initiative of the next SGA if the twowere elected.We further agree with Singh's proposal to investigate cheaper dining options.Singh's emphasis on tangible ideas for change and future goals for Emory and SGA give us the utmostconfidence in endorsing her for the position of SGA EVP.Our Pick: No ConfidenceDue to her lack of achievable initiatives, passion and innovation, the Wheel's Endorsement Committeeunanimously voted "no confidence" in College junior Molly Zhu for the position of College Council (CC)president.Zhu, who is running unopposed, is serving her third year on CC, currently as chief of staff. Shepreviously served as a sophomore legislator and as a freshman legislator.While Zhu has experience in CC and we applaud her goals of transparency, equity and inclusion, herplatform lacks the specific, concrete steps necessary to bring about tangible change. Zhu has noopponent and seemed to take her potential appointment as CC president for granted; she was illprepared for both the Wheel's interview and the Wheel Debates, merely parroting buzzwords such as"transparency," "inclusion" and "equity." Though she hopes to accomplish initiatives such as"strengthening the liaison system between CC and chartered organizations," she did not define specificactions to achieve these goals.Zhu seemed to lack the passion that all other candidates possessed in her platform, interview with theEndorsement Committee and performance in the Wheel Debates. For instance, in Zhu's platform, shestates she will "present a willingness" to initiate conversations with all organizations on campus. Thisclaim is worrisome, as it suggests that Zhu desires only to appear willing to engage with these groupsinstead of genuinely caring about creating equity between organizations. We believe that holding a CCpresidential position requires a genuine passion for moving CC initiatives forward.Zhu also lacks the innovation and initiative necessary for a successful CC president. In the WheelDebates, she stated that she does not believe that CC's funding of student organizations in the last yearis problematic or that she can do anything to change it, despite the fact that nearly half of the availablefunding was given to 12 of the 129 organizations that CC funded last year. She also stated that shecannot control which clubs approach CC for funding. Moreover, although Zhu plans to create a forum ofclass syllabi as CC president, CC already attempted to put a course syllabi and class comments forumin place via Blackboard in October 2014, an initiative with which Zhu was involved as a CC sophomorelegislator.Zhu has demonstrated a lack of initiative, passion and ability to create innovative, achievable goals.While her platform states that she will "lead Emory into a new era," we believe that Zhu could only leadCC into an era characterized by the current status quo and without any tangible progress or change.Our Pick: Dennis KamaraThe Wheel's Endorsement Committee stands behind College junior Dennis Kamara for College Council(CC) vice president. Kamara has demonstrated a passion for affecting change on campus, particularlyfor marginalized groups, and we believe that he will be able to leverage his newcomer status to disruptthe same-old, same-old of CC's bureaucracy, which has primarily been the domain of those in GreekLife.Kamara, who recently became a senior legislator in the CC, is involved in both leadership andmembership roles throughout campus, acting as a Sophomore Adviser (SA) and then a ResidenceAdviser (RA) in Residence Life, a member of Emory's Black Student Association (BSA), a staff memberof Volunteer Emory and a marketing and programming associate with Emory Entrepreneurship andVenture Management (EEVM). He knows the campus and the needs and demands of its studentorganizations that CC most needs to serve.Although he would have had only one semester's worth of CC experience, Kamara has developed thenecessary skills to serve in a leadership position through his other extracurricular activities. Furthermore,he has committed himself to learning how the organization functions by carefully studying the CC's rules.In his current position as a senior legislator, he has taken the initiative to attend numerous CollegeCouncil-hosted events, including Chipotle Chats, and has traveled to the Oxford campus in order toassess the unique needs of its students.The opposing candidate, College sophomore Cassidy Schwartz, has been involved in CC since herfreshman year and is quite qualified for the position of vice president, but she also represents acontinuation of a pre-established CC hierarchy. Kamara, soon-to-be a senior, would not be bound by thedesire to secure support for a CC presidential campaign, a luxury Schwartz does not share. He could doanything within the confines of his position to reform the recruitment and outreach of the organizationwithout fear of future conflict.Kamara represents a needed change to reinvigorate College Council, and we have confidence that hewould make the organization more transparent and more responsive to the needs of our community ifelected vice president.Our Pick: Ria SabnisThe Wheel's Endorsement Committee unanimously endorses Business School junior Ria Sabnis for theposition of Student Programming Council (SPC) president due to her experience, passion and initiative tocreate more transparency and less homogeneity in SPC.We believe that prior experience is necessary in any candidate, and while both Sabnis and her opponent,B-School junior Marisa Hann, have experience on SPC and are qualified to be president, Sabnis' workdemonstrates that she possesses traits essential for an SPC president. Sabnis has been a member ofSPC since her freshman year, and is currently serving as SPC vice president. Hann, who has alsoserved since freshman year and is currently Dooley's Week chair, previously served in severalpositions, such as Taste of Emory co-chair and Homecoming chair. Sabnis stands out, however,because she launched SPC's first Publicity Committee, an initiative that shows her innovation andleadership skills. As SPC vice president, she handles SPC's internal affairs, from communicationbetween current members to recruitment of new members.SPC's budget has historically been a point of contention on campus. We do not condone the use ofunsubstantiated buzzwords, such as "transparency," a term which is used incessantly in variouscampaigns across Emory's campus, often without significant or well-reasoned initiatives. However,Sabnis' platform of transparency, though an idea that she only explicitly mentions once, is fullysubstantiated. If elected, Sabnis vows to "publish an accessible and easy-to-read explanation of SGA'sfunding process that SPC takes part in." While Hann also plans to make the budget more transparentthrough "town halls and by developing online visual info graphics," we feel that a published documentwould reach more students than a town hall event that many students might not attend. Having SPC'sbudget reach the most students on campus is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the organization as itfaces increasing scrutiny from the Emory community. It is therefore necessary that the organization'snext president be adept in communicating with individual students.Sabnis' openness towards addressing issues of homogeneity within SPC was an important factor infinalizing our decision. In the past, SPC has been criticized for the uniform, unvaried traits of itsmembers. While both candidates acknowledged in the Wheel Debates that SPC has a predominatelywhite, upper-middle class and Greek Life-involved makeup, Sabnis offered a more concrete plan in herplatform for an overhaul of SPC's membership than did Hann. She said that under her leadership, fromthe beginning of recruitment through final selection of members, "SPC [would] work harder to recruitmembers who reflect and represent the racial, religious and socioeconomic diversity of the entireUniversity." In an interview with the Committee, Sabnis also stated that we are "a university thatcelebrates diversity inclusion," and that she hopes to change the way in which SPC represents theUniversity population through "blanket programming for the entire community." While Hann, in herinterview, discussed the initiatives she has begun in order to reach out to groups underrepresented onSPC, her official platform fails to outline such measures.Sabnis' passion, drive, open-mindedness and experience give the Committee confidence that she is themore qualified candidate for SPC president, although neither candidate is unqualified for the position.
