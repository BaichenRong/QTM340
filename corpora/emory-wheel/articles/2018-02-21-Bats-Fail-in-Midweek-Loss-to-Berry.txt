During the ensuing at-bat, the Wesleyan base-runnersophomore designated hitter Nick Beaver scurried to second base after a wild-pitch and advanced tothird base after another single. Unable to work out of the jam, Brereton balked, advancing the third-baserunner across home plate.Matters only became worse for Brereton. His day came to an end after two runners crossed home platedue to a throwing error from senior shortstop Nick Chambers.Freshman pitcher Jared Gaer came in relief of Brereton and cleaned up the mess, retiring all threebatters he faced in the inning and giving up only one more run on a sacrifice fly.Barring a tie ballgame, the first game of the double-header was scheduled to end in seven innings sincethe Wesleyan stadium has no lights and the two games had to finish before dark.Headed into the top of the seventh inning, the Eagles were up against the wall, down two runs with onelast chance to bat. Emory rallied, matching Wesleyan's four-running inning with one of their own.Stern, senior first baseman Bubby Terp and sophomore second baseman Ryan Adelman all drove inruns. Another Emory baserunner, Brereton, was brought home on a wild pitch.Gaer kept the Bishops off the scoreboard in the bottom of the seventh and locked in Emory's 7-5 victory.The Eagles met a different fate in the second game, falling to the Bishops 5-3.Head Coach Mike Twardoski said that it was difficult for the team to play a double-header after anintense day of traveling and a closely contested first game."We traveled eight hours to play a doubleheader and the guys got tired by the second game," Twardoskisaid. "In the first game we came out swinging well and our bats were great, but by the second game wedidn't have the same level of success."Senior pitcher Mack Wilkins started on the mound for Emory and lasted only two and two-thirds inningsafter giving up two runs on three hits and three walks. After Wilkins's start, five other Emory pitcherscontributed to getting the team through five and a third innings.Increasing their margin to five, Wesleyan added one run in the fourth and two in the fifth. In the meantime,Wesleyan's starting pitcher junior J.D. Makauskas completed seven shutout innings, giving up four hitsand a walk with six strikeouts.Twardoski said the team should have competed better against Makauskas and utilized a more effectivegameplan."We should have hit better and had better gameplans at the plate in the second game," Twardoski said. "[Makauskas] was a fine pitcher, but we could have easily hit him better than we did since nothing he didwas overwhelming."The Eagles decreased the deficit in the top of the eighth, scoring three runs on three hits from Brereton,Stern and Terp.Despite the three-run eighth inning, the Eagles could not to replicate that success in the top of the ninthand lost the game 5-3.Twardoski said the team needs more contributions from the bottom of the batting order to complementthe success of the leadoff hitters."Our players at the bottom of the order have to string some better at-bats together," Twardoski said."They're swinging out of the strike right now, but they're capable of putting some good at-bats together tobring us back to the start of the lineup."Sophomore pitcher Richard Brereton said although the Eagles have had a lackluster start, the team isgaining valuable time on the field."We're improving every game and playing well as a team," Brereton said. "We're talented and young, wejust need experience as the season goes on and we'll keep improving."Terp, Stern and Brereton are Emory's three most productive hitters thus far. Together they haveaccumulated more than half of the team's RBIs. Stern leads the team with a .528 batting average andhas tallied the most RBIs with 16.The Eagles have a week off before they are scheduled to play Birmingham Southern College (Ala.)
