Gender-inclusive language is meant to accommodate those whose gender identity cannot becategorized as “male” or “female” and those who reject standard masculine and feminine pronouns.College junior and SGA President Jon Darby, who co-authored the bill along with College sophomore andSGA Campus Services Chairman Max Zoberman, explained that the idea for the amendment came tohim on National Coming Out Day last year, when he was asked to consider what he could do to makethe Emory community more inclusive.“It struck me when I was reading through the Constitution that there were lots of ‘he or her’ and ‘she orhim,’” Darby said. “I didn’t think those were very inclusive pronouns, and I knew that [this change] wassomething very tangible that I could do to make the realm of student government more inclusive topeople who may not identify with those pronouns.”According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, non-binary identities include those individualswho are genderqueer, a term for those who identify as neither entirely male nor entirely female, or gendernon-conforming, a term for those whose gender expression from societal gender roles, among others.The movement for gender-inclusive language has evolved and at times goes head-to-head withadvocates for English grammar. Using “they” pronouns to refer to singular people, some critics haveargued, is grammatically incorrect because “they” is standardly used to refer to multiple people.“The reason I wrote it that way is because when I talk to people about this issue, they normally get reallyhung up on the singular ‘they,’” Darby said. “It’s strange to use ‘they’ in a singular form, but I didn’t thinkthat was a good enough reason to not have an inclusive pronoun.”College junior and Vice President of Emory Pride Nowmee Shehab, who is also a member of EmoryPride, also noted the irrelevance of grammar rules.“Language is fluid and changes everyday,” Shehab said. “I think having gender inclusive language in ourConstitution should be prioritized over following an outdated and elitist idea of linguistic rigidity.”The actual text of the amendment expresses the need for a governing document that does notmarginalize certain groups on campus with outdated and wording. Furthermore, the amendment givescontext for the move by referencing various sources that attest to the fact that gender is a socialconstruction, that gender-inclusive pronouns are grammatically correct and viable and that organizationssuch as Facebook have already adopted “they/their” as a substitute for “he/she” and “his/her.”Darby said that through the process of researching the use of “they” as a singular pronoun, he learnedthat the singular “they” is not only grammatically correct but is also highly practical and expedient incertain circumstances. In an effort to anticipate arguments about this specific use of the singular “they,”Darby cited some of this research within the text of the amendment.“This [amendment] represents a change in ideology,” Zoberman said. “This doesn’t affect anyone’spocket, this doesn’t affect anyone’s life … This would be the University’s way of putting its money whereits mouth is and saying ‘we’re ready to be better.’”However, Kroeger said they were concerned that the amendment does not go far enough to demonstratethat Emory is committed to education and inclusion.“I think the change is of huge symbolic nature,” Kroeger said. “However, I hope that Emory is dedicatedto actually educating students on social issues rather than remaining content with symbols as theinstitution has in the past.”Shehab also expressed concern about discrimination on campus.“Trans and genderqueer people face extreme marginalization in society and, even within our Emorybubble, face exclusion and discrimination,” Shehab said.According to Darby, despite the difficulty of passing amendments — he noted that the Constitution hadnot changed much in recent decades — he was optimistic about the likelihood that this amendmentwould be approved.“I’m hoping that with this particular amendment, people see that we’re trying to create a more inclusivecommunity and make sure that people feel welcome,” Darby said.Zoberman emphasized the importance of passing the amendment.“We [must] show that we are ready to be a modern University with modern ideas,” he said. “If there wasserious legislative opposition, it would be disgraceful.”At the meeting, there was no debate regarding the amendment, and the bill passed unanimously withoutany dissent.—By Rupsha Basu, News Editor and Luke White, SGA Beat Writer
