From the outside, the Media, Literature and Arts Outreach (MLAO) house at Emory is indistinguishablefrom the fraternity houses that surround it â€” large and regal, only missing Greek letters.Apart from the pool table in one of the rooms, venturing inside the house, the space feels very much likean art gallery. Visitors immediately see the plentiful display of vibrant student artwork, some of whichwas created by house's own residents."Anyone can reserve a room at any time if they just want it for personal reasons to do some painting oranything like that," said Juliana Bonovich, College junior, resident advisor and co-lead of the MLAOhouse.Even though not every room has an art display, all non-residential rooms in the house are utilized for artrelated means.Starting the house was no easy task; Emory released the application for themed housing on Eagle Rowjust a week before the end of the Spring 2015 semester.College senior Nick Bowman, one of the co-leads of the house, came up with the idea of a media houseand proposed it to the Media Council at Emory, a consortium of several student-run publication groups.Bonovich, co-president of The Pulse, an anthology of the arts, was interested in the idea of starting athemed house that would include literature and the visual arts.Using some of her prior experience with Emory Residence Life (she was a sophomore advisor inLongstreet-Means Hall the prior year), Bonovich sent in an application for the potential theme.As part of the application, Bonovich needed to send in a preliminary roster of people interested in living inthe house, a task that required a great deal of publicizing. It was an especially challenging feat whenpeople already had housing plans for the following school year.Even amidst final exams, she was able to get 60 people on the roster for the 40 open spots to live in thehouse. Because Bonovich submitted the application for the themed housing, she was responsible forreading the applications from students who wanted to live in the house as well as for placing people inrooms.The MLAO house, which was previously occupied by a fraternity, is not a Greek-life house and istherefore governed under the same rules as Emory residence halls. Since art encompases so manyaspects of the house, MLAO brings the art community together with its multimodal space.The house is diverse in its residents, who encompass a wide variety of disciplines. The residents includevisual artists, creative writing majors and members of several media clubs. However, not everyone wasstrongly involved in the arts at Emory prior to living in the house.College sophomore Matt Huang, for example, was not part of any art clubs at Emory prior to joining theMLAO house. However, he did film in high school and, upon joining MLAO, was motivated to engage inthat interest by joining The Emory Spoke's film sketch team.In addition to MLAO serving as a catalyst for unifying the different arts organizations on campus, thereare a handful of events at the house in which many of its residents and students in the Emorycommunity showcase their work.There were a number of MLAO events this past month. In October, MLAO hosted a visual arts exhibitioncalled the Peacock Gallery and put on the first Student Arts Fair on McDonough Field in order to givestudents a chance both to showcase and sell their work. Strategically planned during Family Weekend,the students registered to sell their work were allowed to keep 100 percent of their profits.The residents of the MLAO house hosted several events in honor of Halloween, such as caramel appledecorating and pumpkin carving. In addition, organizations such as The Pulse utilize the space for theirgeneral body meetings and student readings.The house also hosts Open Mics every other week, which typically have a modest turnout. According toBonovich, the first Open Mic had nearly 40 people."I think that, for a pilot program, we've been pretty successful," she said.
