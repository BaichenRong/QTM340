Dear Editor,Given recent campus events, Emory community members have inquired regarding the University'spolicy and practice for distributing campus-wide messages from leadership.At Emory we try to examine each issue, listen to our community and make the best decision for how tobe supportive. Our intent is to ensure that leadership messages focus on issues directly connected toour community or on global events that directly impact our community.Leadership communication takes many forms: The president and her leadership team are activelyengaged in meeting and communicating with students and others on and off campus; emails may besent from the president and other leaders to the entire or a segment of our community; Universitystatements may be posted to a website; and the president and other leaders attend vigils and othermemorial events.There will be times when a presidential communication to the entire community is appropriate given whatwe know about a particular circumstance and the nature of the issue. There will be times when otherleaders may represent the University because they are closest to the situation and those affected.Emory, like other universities, is exploring the best method of communicating to our audiences in ameaningful way. The Communications and Public Affairs division is working with University leaders todevelop guidelines for campus-wide messages and to create a central communications vehicle that willprovide an update on issues so that the community can have one source of accurate, updatedinformation.We also are looking at employee communication and student communication channels now tounderstand preferences and usage practices. This work will inform us on how leadership communicationtakes place in the future.We will keep the Emory community updated on our progress, and we welcome your input.Sincerely,Nancy SeidemanVice President for Academic CommunicationsCommunications and Public AffairsThe post Letter to the Editor: On Campus-Wide Message Distribution appeared first on The EmoryWheel.
