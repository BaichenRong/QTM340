WellStar announced on Tuesday that they have decided not to join Emory Healthcare. This came justtwo months after Emory Healthcare and WellStar Health System announced plans to merge and createone of the largest health care systems in the Southeast.Emory learned of WellStar’s decision on Tuesday morning just before WellStar released its statementinforming the public of their decision not to participate in the merger, according to University PresidentJames W. Wagner.“It was a decision that, just the prior week, we were not expecting,” Wagner said, emphasizing hissurprise upon receiving the news.Wagner noted that people he and his colleagues at Emory were mostly surprised because WellStar hadcancelled the merger before even entering into the design phase.Both entities had come to a place where “we were going to commit afresh to the design phase,” Wagnersaid.As a part of this phase, WellStar and Emory would have negotiated operational issues and planned tolaunch the united system in about a year, according to Wagner. However, there was no guarantee thatthe design phase wouldn’t have complications, Wagner said.As for why WellStar decided to pull out, Wagner said that he doesn’t know the company’s reasoning butthat he “imagine(s) it might have been in anticipation of concerns down the road.”According to Andy Miller, CEO and editor of the online publication Georgia Health News, a huge issue forthe merger was determining “who would be the top dog,” he said in an interview with Atlanta radio stationWABE.“Emory and WellStar both wanted the upper hand,” Miller said.However, according to Wagner, this wasn’t necessarily the case. Emory and WellStar had worked hardto imagine the governance structure of the new conglomerate, he said.“We recognized it was hard work but it wasn’t contentious,” Wagner said of the governance structureplanning.Miller also recognized the differences in the two institutions — Emory as an academic institution andWellStar as a community-based health system — as a source of difficulty.Wagner said he’s not sure if this difference was one of the reasons WellStar decided to discontinue theirplans with Emory, but that Emory always believed these differences would create “a wonderful blend ofterrific community healthcare and academics.”Despite the failure to merge with Emory, WellStar indicated that it plans to “accelerate” opportunities tomerge with other potential partners, according to the June 9 press release. WellStar did not indicate theirreasons for pulling out of the merger and declined for further comment.Wagner confirmed that Emory Healthcare is still open to merging with another entity, adding that mergershas become a trend in healthcare nationwide. Still, Emory doesn’t have any potential partners lined up,Wagner said.Beth Stephens, the director of the Health Access Program at Georgia Watch, an Atlanta-basedconsumer advocacy group with a focus on hospitals, said that when the merger was first announced shefeared price increases without an equal increase in care.In an interview with the Wheel, Stephens said that, although she didn’t have a particular position on themerger, she wished the process had been more transparent.Stephens said that both the motivations behind the merger and the reasons for not continuing with theplanned merger are unclear.Stephens added that it would have been nice to hear some guarantees from the health care giantsthroughout the process. She pointed out that Georgia Watch submitted public comments to both entitiesand heard back from neither.According to Stephens, we are likely to see other mergers happen in the health care market due to theindustry’s changing climate and its high rate of mergers nationwide.“It will be interesting to see what happens when the next merger is proposed,” Stephens said.
