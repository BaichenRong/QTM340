This month’s debate, courtesy of the Barkley Forum, is on whether or not Emory should move forwardon financial aid for undocumented services and was written by Barkley Forum Members Nate Sawyerand Katie Duval.PROEmory University Policy 1.3.1, The Equal Opportunities and Non-Discrimination Policy:“Emory University is dedicated to providing equal opportunities to all individuals regardless of race, color,religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genderexpression, veteran status or any factor that is prohibited consideration under applicable law.”This policy stands as a hallmark of inclusion and accessibility to some, but conditional, lip service toothers. Does Emory’s policy truly promote “equal opportunity” and “non-discrimination”?Our current response to the plight of undocumented youth attempting to farther their education calls intoquestion this commitment.The conversation regarding the rights of undocumented students seeking higher education is one thattakes place on multiple college campuses nation-wide.New York University is the most recent addition to a list of peer institutions working to increaseeducational access for undocumented students that already includes Amherst, Dartmouth, Harvard andYale. Others like Berea, Tougaloo and Hampshire have gone even farther and offered full scholarshipsfor academically promising students.Can Emory be a truly commit itself to developing a just and equitable world while failing to support someof the more vulnerable members of our communities — undocumented youth?Freedom at Emory, a student initiative formed this year in partnership with Freedom University, answersthis question with a resounding no.Freedom University is a free volunteer-run underground university providing college-level classes forundocumented students prohibited from attending public schools in Georgia by the Georgia Board ofRegents.Laura Emiko Soltis, an Emory graduate and executive director at Freedom University, argues that theUniversity is playing a key role in combatting the “modern era of educational segregation in the South.”Freedom at Emory has been aiding this effort with student volunteers helping to facilitate classes oncollege preparation, including SAT preparation and navigating the college application process, as well aspublic speaking and debate.While both initiatives are crucial steps in the right direction, neither can replace the importance ofeducational access to institutions like Emory.However, admission at Emory is only half the battle.While undocumented students can be admitted to Emory, as students are typically coming from lowincome backgrounds, Emory’s failure to provide students with financial support in addition to acceptanceeffectively bars access to qualified students. Worse, Emory admits undocumented students asinternational students and requires proof of ones ability to pay full tuition. This system magnifiesproblems of financial access that already impacts undocumented students because of their inability toaccess federal loans and scholarships because of a lack of documentation.Our failure to provide financial support is as effective as an overt ban in keeping undocumented studentsoff our campus and out of our classrooms.Private universities like Emory, not subject to the draconian restrictions of Georgia’s Board of Regents’Policy 4.1.6, are uniquely situated at the front lines of hope for undocumented youth.Stripped of access to the top public universities and mandated out-of-state tuition for the otherinstitutions, undocumented youth are institutionally deprived of social and economic mobility.Emory has the ethical responsibility to circumvent this systematic deprivation of rights and opportunity.Arguments justifying the offer, or denial, of aid for undocumented students because of their contributionsto business, engineering and the overall American economy and society are almost entirely beside thepoint: this is first and foremost an issue of human rights. Undocumented students have already likelyfaced a lifetime of fear of deportation, accompanying emotional turmoil and the hardships of a strugglingfamily, the challenges of relative poverty and assimilation into a new culture and language, restrictedaccess to health care, and more, all on top of the often-accompanied suite of challenges part and parcelto living in America as an ethnic minority.As such, Emory’s policies, or lack thereof, are not neutral reflections of a sympathetic, but hand-tiedadministration without the resources necessary to create change. Instead, how we use our endowment,how we structure our scholarship policies and programs, are decisions that either do or do not reflectcomplicity in longstanding histories of discrimination and still-pervasive systems of racist-nativism, asLindsay Pérez Huber, postdoctoral scholar at the University of California All Campus Consortium OnResearch for Diversity, argues.Such systems of oppression cannot be separated from questions of how Emory ought to respond,particularly if we are to tout ourselves as an “ethically engaged and diverse community.”Emory’s community stands to benefit enormously from inclusion of undocumented students as well.Conversations in the classroom and out become enriched, calcified notions of privilege becomechallenge and the demand to understand our ethical responsibility to others becomes a far morepressing, and immediate, concern.Thus while recent discussion between Freedom at Emory students and President James W. Wagner isan important start, progress is sometimes too slow. As Andy Kim, co-founder of Freedom at Emory,pointed out in his interview with The Emory Wheel, “What didn’t come up in the meeting were immediatethings Emory could do as undocumented students open their financial aid packages in April. There arekids right now who will find out that they cannot attend college for another year or so.”Opinions of the University alumni base seem to be shifting in response to recent demands for changewith the GALA Steering Committee and Emory’s LGBT Alumni supporting Freedom at Emory’s initiative.But even if there are remaining concerns about backlash from the Georgia community, the alumni base,and others, then that is precisely why Emory University should take a stand by increasing its financialassistance and easing access to scholarships for undocumented students.The administration should not hold itself hostage to conservative opinions that promote, as Soltis put it, a“modern era of educational segregation in the South.”Taking a stand would allow Emory to serve as a model for other universities, both state and nation wide,and would provide a crucial counter-narrative to the logic of the Board of Regents’ policy.As previously demanded by students and faculty alike, Emory should add “documentation status” toEmory’s Equal Opportunities and Non-Discrimination Policy, while also restructuring undocumentedstudents’ financial aid and scholarship opportunities so as to more accurately reflect the inequality of bothopportunity and condition that these students have faced their entire lives. Until then, Emory’s selfproclaimed role as an “ethical leader” will remain a façade: true in some cases but a mere illusion inothers.CONFreedom University is an organization dedicated to challenging the systematic exclusion ofundocumented youth from higher education in Georgia. It is responding to a set of unjust policiesestablished by the Georgia Board of Regents that prevent undocumented immigrants from applying tothe top five public universities in the state. Emory has already made efforts to distance itself from thepolicies of the BOR by allowing undocumented youth to be admitted. Our next step should be to find thebest way to support Freedom University without simultaneously damaging their and our long-term cause.A rash move to provide full tuition to a few individuals will do very little for the vast majority impacted bythe BOR’s decisions. However, its risks could result in a virulent anti-immigrant backlash on our campusproducing policies similar to those created by the Board of Regents. The political and economic climatesurrounding immigration demands that we approach any immediate and substantial response with agreat deal of caution. We must not ignore that Emory’s offering financial aid to undocumented immigrantsrequires the support of numerous important stakeholders with various political beliefs, economicinterests and expectations.Providing financial assistance while Georgia’s Board of Regents’ Policy 4.1.6 is still law will turn ourefforts into a political firestorm. Jack Stripling, writing for Inside Higher Ed news, indicates that thequestion of undocumented students within university systems is a “very polarizing issue about whichreasonable people can disagree” and that “even a local case involving a single undocumented studenthas caused impassioned debate.” One only has to look at the tremendous support for the GeorgiaUniversity System Board of Regents’ policy 4.1.6 to understand just how unremarkable thesestatements are. The opposition argued that “illegal immigrants were overrunning the system, drainingtaxpayer dollars and squeezing out qualified Georgians who might otherwise have been admitted to thestate’s most competitive colleges” and were often too stubborn to consider the facts of the matter.Joshua Jones, writing for Athens’ Flagpole Magazine, notes that many politicians, state and universityalike, have found cracking down on immigrants a way to “score political points.” One would not beshocked to see a similar line of argument forwarded on our campus when we consider the racial politicsthat already exist on the campus. When the economic climate is perceived to be zero sum, it would benaïve for us to believe that a sizeable number of students would perceive Emory’s support forundocumented youth as coming at their expense.While it seems like our school should be insulated from the politics of the state public university system,this is obviously not the case. Given that a large percentage of money for the University comes fromdonations and research grants, public image is of the utmost importance to the administration. Accordingto Emory’s website, “In 2013-14, $430,197,650 in financial aid was awarded to Emory students” and 40percent of that aid was made possible through donations. Without the favor of major interest groups, it ispossible that Emory will not be able to follow through with its commitment to provide financial support forstudents.While the administration shouldn’t make drastic changes in response to Freedom University, the currentgradual approach is appropriate and historically effective. Although it is true that there are noundocumented students receiving aid today, the steady and gradual acceptance of Freedom Universityand its mission will inevitably bear fruit and give us time to lay the groundwork for sustainable change.Recently, representatives from Freedom University met with President Wagner and received acommitment to form a “working group” that will explore how the University can adequately work with theorganization. All present deemed the meeting a success. Additionally, representatives of the BarkleyForum Center for Debate Education are operating in partnership with Freedom University to provide apublic speaking and debate course on Sundays.The Barkley Forum will host a series of public debates later this year to highlight the importance ofchanging the national dialogue on undocumented youth and educational access. The notion that Emoryis doing nothing on this issue ignores the outstanding work being done by Freedom at Emory and theBarkley Forum to support Freedom University and create a sustainable policy change on our campus.This gradual approach is far superior to funding one or two students and jeopardizing our ability totransform the political climate in the long-term.If people really want undocumented immigrants to have a chance to attend Emory, they should besupporting the progress that has been made, not calling for radical policy shifts. If the administration wereto blanket accept what Freedom University is requesting, it runs the risk of ostracizing our main donorsand members of board who functionally control the funding of the aid system. Not only is the financial aidfor undocumented immigrants infeasible, it is likely that others who need aid would be negativelyaffected. In regards to Freedom University, the administration must continue their current approach:treading lightly and adjusting gradually.
