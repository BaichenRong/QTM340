With the inauguration of President Trump drawing near, highlighting the role of facts in the countlessupcoming policy debates is crucial.The press has traditionally parsed truth from fiction in presenting their findings to the American people. Itis often said that a free press strengthens the government's civic accountability. A free press, however,means little if the American people do not trust it.Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. A 2016 Gallup study made it clear that news organizations havebeen losing trust. The most visible manifestation of this trend is the dramatic rise in fake news: a threat tothe nation's public discourse regarding important political issues. With fraudulent stories like the Popeendorsing Trump going viral, the American public has become susceptible to misinformation.Though media organizations have their share of blame, Trump's actions contributed to the diminishmentof public trust in America's mainstream press. He has routinely berated and dismissed those institutionsthat break from his view of reality or have the gall to run a story he views as unfavorable towards him.For example, during his campaign, Trump revoked the press credentials of reputable media outletsincluding The Washington Post, Politico and The Huffington Post.Central to the mission of Emory is finding and spreading truth; the seal of the University consists of acrossed torch and trumpet which represent knowledge and its proclamation, respectively.
