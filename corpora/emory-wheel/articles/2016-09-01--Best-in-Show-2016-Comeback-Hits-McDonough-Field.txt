AuralPleasure, Emory's oldest co-ed a cappella group, kick-started the night with a mellowed-down version ofHalsey's "Castle" soloed by College senior Cathy Tang. Their soft, haunting voices mesmerized theaudience into a silent reverie, providing a stark contrast against the upbeat Zuri and Vibez, African andCaribbean dance groups, respectively. The energy and dynamism of Zuri and Vibez fed off of eachother. Zuri and Vibez performed one after the other, passionately expressing the cultures through theirdances. The two groups bounced off of each other, showcasing lively back-to-back dances.Alternating between a cappella, dance and other performances, such as musical and rock songs, paidoff, because it left the audience guessing what would be next on the program. From hip-hop, cultural andtap dancing to religious and traditional music, there were a variety of styles and cultures for everyone'stastes. The melting pot of performances featured in "Best in Show" beautifully represented the diversestudent body at Emory, and students were able to appreciate various cultural and stylistic performances.Emory's tap dancing group, Tap That, performed an upbeat dance routine to music, including AndyGrammer's "Honey I'm Good," while Persuasion, an all-female hip-hop crew, left their mark on theaudience with a fast-paced routine that featured dramatic build-ups to climaxes that elicited franticcheers. The girls' sass and confidence emanated throughout their performance as they moved withpracticed precision accented by individual touches of sensuality. Although they moved in sync, eachmaintained her individuality.Brotherhood for Afrocentric Men (BAM) and Ngambika incorporated history into their performances byalternating between stepping and spoken word. Individual members stepped forward to inform the crowdof their organizations' beginnings and goals through dialogue with one another and with the audience.Each performer's distinct personality provided a distinct sense of authenticity and relatability — theycared about what they were saying. It mattered. Despite its length, the performance didn't contain asingle dull moment due to both the unique call-and-response format between BAM and Ngambika andtheir pure inherent passion.To end the event, Karma Bhangra left the audience pumped and content thanks to their colorful Indianattire and a medley of constant shifting between traditional Indian and modern American music. Theirdance utilized every part of their bodies, even extending to colorful sticks that they twirled around.Despite the obvious physical exertion required, the dancers moved flawlessly, all the while engaged andenlivened in their performance. During the vast majority of "Best in Show," the audience remained quietand reserved; yet with their powerful finish to the event, Karma Bhangra seemingly awakened the crowdwith the same liveliness that was present at the beginning of the night.Not only does "Best in Show" celebrate the talents of various students, it also shows freshmen a glimpseof Emory's undeniable spirit, zest and identity and reminds upperclassmen of why we returned foranother year. There's no better way to close Orientation Week than with a splash of dance, a sprinkle ofsong and a whole lot of welcoming.The incredible diversity that punctuated the program — a capella, cultural dance, hip-hop, musicaltheater — presented a continuous unpredictability that kept the audience engaged, surprised and oftenexposed to new forms of performance art.
