Courtesy of Flickr Creative CommonsCreated this year by College junior Zachary Issenberg, the Emory Literary Club (ELC) is for students ofall backgrounds, interests and majors who are interested in honing their writing skills."I just want to make a free, open space where people practice writing together," Issenberg said. "Not forany social gain, but specifically because writing is important to figure out oneself."The club began as a space for Issenberg and his peers to improve their writing outside of the classroom.Soon, it expanded to include students outside of his social circle and from different academic disciplines.Issenberg said the structure of the club emulates that of Emory's Creative Writing Program. There aredifferent workshops, either in fiction, nonfiction or poetry, composed of a small number of students whomeet weekly to discuss their work.Each workshop is organized by Issenberg and other upperclassmen, and the club is sponsored byAssociate Professor of English Jericho Brown.Issenberg communicates with other faculty, including Creative Writing Professor of Practice JimGrimsley and James M. Cox Jr. Professor of Journalism Hank Klibanoff. Grimsley and Klibanoff offervaluable advice in fiction and nonfiction, respectively, to the students in the different workshops.According to Issenberg, the environment of the ELC is a much different one compared to that of aclassroom."By making it this very inclusive space, I hope to remove the ego and stress that comes from [working]in a classroom," Issenberg said.College junior Charles Seidman, who describes himself as the "organizer and head dreamer" of thefiction workshop, elaborated on the dynamics that the out-of-classroom experience creates."We attempt to create just enough pressure to get people to write freely, but not so much pressure thatthe club begins to resemble a class," Seidman said.Because of the freedom the students have in the club, a different energy is created for the student leader,the students as a collective group and the students as individuals.College senior Jenny Wu, who leads the poetry section, shared how the voluntary nature of theworkshop translates into students who are "highly motivated, independent poets who genuinely want toimprove their craft."According to Wu, through the small workshop size, the students receive individualized attention, which inturn allows them to have a more structured, intimate and rigorous learning experience.According to Issenberg, ELC not only provides an opportunity to develop one's writing skills, but it alsoprovides students who mostly study outside of the humanities with the opportunity to work with otherswho are more familiar with the craft.By welcoming students from a whole range of academic backgrounds, Issenberg believes that everyonewill be able to share their thought processes for writing and learning. He also believes this interactionworks as a substitute for the competition of "best" literary style, a competition which occurs often amongstudents from similar academic backgrounds.In addition, the ELC discussions are generated beyond the limits of just American literature. According toIssenberg, the limits are broken by having different "styles of readership."By increasing the intersections of the academic realms, students encounter ideas and notions they maynever have found within the confines of a single field of study.Issenberg also elaborated on the value of the club in the context of an institution that is the highestranked university in the country for creative writing."I realized that so many people in the humanities sort of go through the process of fulfilling their major,but not knowing what comes next," Issenberg said.This realization led Issenberg to create the ELC's academic essay workshop, where students learn toread and research essays in order to grasp some of the components of graduate-level work.In this academic workshop, Issenberg steers away from the role of an instructor and attempts to behaveas a guide leading students to a higher level of writingâ€“beyond the undergraduate level.For example, rather than teaching students about methods and structures that Issenberg hasn't beenformally trained in, he provides the students with other resources and essays that are more well-versedin these methodologies.To deepen and enrich the experience of the students of this section, Issenberg hopes to have professorsfrom various departments in the humanities speak and interact directly with students.While the dynamics of the club are unique and beneficial to the students who participate in the club, theworkshop leaders are learning a lot as well."[ELC] keeps me on my toes," Wu said. "[Because I] assign more theoretical readings that I think willhelp the members, I am able to practice applying theory to real-life situations."Issenberg said the club pushes him to give advice to students that he too, as an undergraduate student,can use."It forces me to practice as much as I physically can because I don't want to imagine that I'm giving theworst advice possible," Issenberg said.Seidman has a much worldlier perception about ELC."The club serves as a constant reminder of just how feckless some people can be," Seidman said.Issenberg re-introduced the idea of the ego in response to his behavior as both a leader and an equal tothe students.While he does his best to advise both the students and the workshop leaders, he also cautions them:"Do your thing, but remember, you are not better than them."The workshop leaders, indeed, are meant to serve as moderators and alternate sources of thoughtrather than as superiors.Issenberg also hopes these dynamics will help students in the workshop learn how to better process andreact to criticism. He explains how criticism, which comes from someone on the same level, promotesthe idea of criticism as a holistic process rather than as an attack or a rejection."Hopefully, it will be a process of people learning to take and accept criticism properly," Issenberg said."You know, at Emory, when you get criticized, your immediate reaction is to criticize [back]. I seecriticism as this beautiful process by which one can learn."This article was updated on Nov. 30 at 3:02 p.m. Hank Klibanoff's title is James M. Cox Jr. Professor ofJournalism.
