Editor's Note: A previous version of this article that was published in the Nov. 28 issue was retractedonline due to inaccuracies. The retracted article erroneously stated that Emory University Student HealthServices (EUSHS) plans to offer rape kits. The story was assigned to a new reporter and re-written.One nurse who works at Emory University Student Health Services (EUSHS) is undergoing training tobecome a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE), according to EUSHS Executive Director SharonRabinovitz.A SANE is a registered nurse with training to provide care for sexual assault victims, conduct a forensicexam and provide expert testimony if the patient decides to bring the case to trial, according to the Rape,Abuse & Incest National Network. Emory University Hospitals and EUSHS don't currently offer SANEprograms.For now, EUSHS will not offer a full SANE program, which would require 24/7 service operated bymultiple SANE-certified nurses, Rabinovitz said. She added that EUSHS currently "does not have theforensic [capacity]" that a full SANE program has and would not recommend students to go to EUSHS ifthey want to obtain forensic evidence. Emory's Respect Program, which offers interpersonal violenceprevention and survivor services, recommends students obtain rape kits from the DeKalb County FamilyProtection Center in Tucker, Ga., a more than seven-mile drive from Emory's Atlanta campus."The SANE program itself is designed to collect criminal evidence for use in criminal prosecutionpotentially and does include a number of components in addition to the medical examination," said PhyllisMiller, executive director of the Day League, which started offering a SANE program at the FamilyProtection Center in May 2018.Rabinovitz said a SANE-trained nurse at EUSHS will be better equipped to treat a patient whoexperienced sexual assault."[In the future,] if somebody came into our office and was a victim of sexual assault, the nurse would bethe person to do the exam," Rabinovitz said. "But we can't have one person covering student healthevery night. It's not something one person can manage. In the moment during the day, that would be theperson we would turn to."The nurse currently undergoing training will not be certified until May at the earliest, Rabinovitz said."We hired her in August, and she was actually already undergoing [SANE] training, so that was one ofthe added benefits of hiring her in particular," Rabinovitz said.Rabinovitz emphasized that EUSHS is in the initial stages of exploring ways to offer "enhanced sexualassault services" on campus, and that she has not yet spoken with Emory Police Department (EPD) orthe Office of Respect about forensic evidence collection.Sexual Assault Peer Advocates (SAPA) co-President Monjori Mukerjee (19C) believes EmoryUniversity Hospital (EUH) should offer SANE services."It would be nice to have SANE-trained nurses as part of the main hospital and hopefully we can worktogether on that," Mukerjee said.Reports of rape on Emory's main campus increased to nine in 2017 from six in 2016 and four in 2015,according to the annual Clery report.Miller highlighted the Day League's commitment to only using SANE-certified nurses. SANE nurses canbecome certified by the International Association of Forensic Nurses (IAFN) after they meet clinicalpractice requirements and pass a certification exam by the IAFN, according to the IAFN website.Miller said maintaining a SANE program in Georgia is difficult because of a shortage of nurses acrossthe state."This is an issue all over the state of Georgia in light of the nursing shortage in our state," Miller wrote inan Oct. 15 email to the Wheel.The post Emory Student Health Services Nurse Undergoing SANE Training appeared first on TheEmory Wheel.
