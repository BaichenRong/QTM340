Fall means the advent of recruitment season for employers seeking to hire new graduates. As agraduating senior, I have first-hand experience with the disparity between opportunities available toCollege of Arts and Sciences students and Goizueta Business School students. College students cannotaccess the Career Management Center, which has a stronger outreach than the Career Center,participate in weekly Goizueta quad kegs or attend weekly networking events hosted by employers.College students aren't pushed to take professional development courses to prepare for jobs â€” Collegestudents don't have to make a LinkedIn account for credit, nor are they given an email signature. One ofthe major motivators for joining the Business School is getting a corporate job, but College studentsshouldn't be deprived of crucial resources and opportunities simply because they didn't sell their souls toa pre-professional track.Pranati Kohli is a College senior from New Delhi, India.
