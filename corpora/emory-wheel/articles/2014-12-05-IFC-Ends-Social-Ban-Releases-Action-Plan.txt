andStephen FowlerAssistant News EditorAfter one month of quiet on Eagle Row, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) unanimously voted to end itsself-imposed suspension of social activities in fraternity houses Tuesday night (Dec. 2) and created aworking action plan with several short- and long-term steps to address issues surrounding sexualassault.The suspension was implemented on Nov. 3 in response to a Nov. 2 report of a sexual assault and otherpast reports of sexual assaults at Emory fraternity houses. According to its Nov. 3 statement, the IFCsaid it would lift the social ban “once we have produced tangible and proactive steps mending the flaws inour social culture at Emory,” and that the pause would be used to “reevaluate how we address theintolerable issues of sexual violence, substance abuse and discrimination” on Emory’s campus.The resulting action plan is a “living document” and creates steps addressing sexual violence, eventmanagement and communications surrounding fraternity life, according to the document. The planincludes steps like requiring registered bartenders or Training for Intervention Procedures (TIPS)-certifiedfraternity brothers to serve alcohol at fraternity parties, creating a Safe Walks program and requiringparty themes to be approved by the Office for Sorority and Fraternity Life (OSFL).

Students and communitymembers can provide feedback to the plan online here.According to Diener, the IFC took a step back to focus on how to amend the problems facing Greek Lifeduring the ban.“​We started the ban. . . after a history of no response, and we said we would lift it when we werecomfortable on the progress we made,” Diener said. “You’re not going to fix sexual assault or substanceabuse in a couple of weeks. They’re public health issues. But I think we were comfortable with where theplan is at right now.”The end of the social ban was only communicated to each of the chapter presidents, IFC presidents andthe administration. Diener said that IFC is working to send out an all-Emory students email about the endof the social ban, similar to how its beginning was announced through an all-Emory email from SeniorVice President and Dean of Campus Life Ajay Nair.Diener said that IFC did not want to extend the ban for an unnecessarily long time.“We never had a set timeline,” Diener said. “Our goals were always to feel ready and comfortable withthe plan, and I think that’s where we’re at right now. . . This was IFC focusing on our own issues, and wewanted to make sure that we were focusing on those issues first, and then we would talk to the public.”The plan “holds IFC members accountable for their actions to accomplish these goals, but also serves tohelp [IFC] communicate our progress to the broader Emory community,” according to the document.The ban suspended all registered parties in fraternity houses, although off-campus events, educationalevents like November’s “Salon” at the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, some brotherhood events andsome recruitment events were allowed, according to Diener, who also said that there were no violationsof the ban other than two excepted semi-formals, which were approved by IFC. Because the suspensionhas now been lifted, fraternities are now able to host official parties.In the introduction of the action plan, the document states that, as part of IFC’s “duty to provide a safeand supportive environment for [its] members and guests, [IFC believes] the proposals in this documentwill improve [its] community and foster lasting relationships that offer real impact.”Diener said the formulation of the action plan was a positive process.“I think it’s created a lot of awareness in the community and created a lot of interesting conversations inthe community,” Diener said, noting that each of the 11 fraternity chapters wrote a statement on how itwould individually respond to sexual assaults at fraternity houses.The 13-page document outlines existing policies, short-term goals and long-term goals for the threeareas of sexual violence prevention, event management and communications and programming. Thedocument states that IFC aims to complete the short-term goals upon the transition to the new executiveboard in January 2015, and long-term goals by fall 2015.Sexual ViolenceIn the area of sexual violence prevention, the document points out several existing procedures andprograms in place to “confront the root causes of sexual and relationship violence head on,” such asZeta Beta Tau fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau sorority’s “Safe, Smart Dating” and the Office of HealthPromotion’s (OHP) Greek Initiative conversation partnership, according to the document.The document also notes that eight of the 11 fraternity chapters include Sexual Assault Peer Advocate(SAPA) training in their new member education experience, although the plan does not include SAPAtraining for all incoming members of IFC chapters.Short-term solutions include the creation of an IFC Liaison to OHP that would “update and communicaterelevant programming to IFC members; coordinate ‘The Talk’ with chapter executive boards; helpchapters plan their semesterly education programming and consult with outside perspective on actionsIFC can take” in regards to policies, according to the document.Additionally, The Talk, a Respect program initiative for Greek life that allows small groups to initiatediscussion about expectations relating to communication and intimacy, will be required of all chapterexecutive boards and the IFC executive board, according to the document.For long term goals, the IFC plan aims to require each chapter to host one event a semester to addresseither sexual violence or substance abuse with at least a 75 percent attendance rate required. If thisattendance is not met, the chapter will face social probation, according to the document.Another change will be made to the Greek 101 New Member Training Program, with IFC partnering withOHP to utilize OHP’s new Active Bystander Skills training, according to the document.Event ManagementThe long-term projects for event management calls for either a licensed third-party bartender to work anevent or a TIPS-trained and identified brother who is responsible for handling the proscribed beer checkstation, according to the document.“I think that’s important because it takes the onus off of individuals and creates a third party for handlingthe situation,” Diener said. “For trained members, IFC is going to be very strict on people going throughthe training process.”Additionally, the Safe Walks program, a new initiative created by College seniors Oliver Paprin and CaraOrtiz beginning next semester, will provide a pair of trained students to walk students home who areuncomfortable walking from Eagle Row across campus to their rooms on Friday and Saturday nights,according to the document. This programs draws on existing initiatives from other schools, according toDiener.Building on the past two years’ worth of changing risk management policies, including the SororityFraternity Life Review Board, nightly walkthroughs of fraternity houses and the recent implementation ofcard readers at registered parties, the IFC plan wants to clarify definitions of events at houses.For example, a guest list party is open to anyone on the guest list, a mixer is restricted to members ofthe two organizations mixing and a date party has one predetermined guest per sponsoring member,according to the document.Other changes include an increase in communication about guest expectations, medical amnesty fororganizations and a requirement of risk managers from non-IFC organizations co-hosting events in thehouse, according to the document.Additionally, IFC calls for the University to provide an alcohol education program that extends beyond thecurrent AlcoholEdu for first-year students and an increase in communication between House directorsand chapter leadership.The final area of recommendations and changes deal with a lack of communication between IFCmembers and the community at large, noting they have been “unsuccessful in maintaining relationshipswith other groups and student organizations on campus.”CommunicationAs an existing step, the Office of Sorority and Fraternity Life created a system for reviewing andsanctioning party themes within Greek life, according to Diener. This change came after feminist groupsat Emory have previously criticized potentially or overtly sexist fraternity party themes over the past fewyears.Before January’s changeover in the IFC executive board, they hope to require new recruits forfraternities to attend a panel in their residence hall to hear expectations of the Greek community, anemail introducing first-year men to IFC’s history and expectations and an expansion of messagingthrough social media, small-scale programming and a strengthened partnership with the Office ofResidence Life.For the long term, IFC aims to draft a new mission statement that better aligns with new programs andefforts to closely align IFC values with the values of the community.Additionally, IFC Vice President of Housing and College senior Nicholas Sommariva, who assisted incompiling the report, was happy that the document incorporated a lot of ideas from a lot of people.“We tried our best in writing this living document to encompass everything and everyone while still beingcomprehensive and practical,” Sommariva said. (Sommariva is a former editor at the Wheel.)When asked why the ban was lifted before the end of the semester, Sommariva said that there wasmuch discussion about the timing of the cessation of the ban.“A lot of conversations were had about when to end it, how to end it, is it right to end it, etcetera,”Sommariva said. “We didn’t feel that waiting to get feedback was necessary because the plan couldnever be a catch-all, end-all.”Sommariva added that he thought keeping the ban in place solely to get feedback from others wasn’tgoing to help anything, because he thought the community had taken the time to step back, reflect andlearn and that the work isn’t done nor will IFC not continue to work with anyone on the plan.College senior Anusha Ravi said she thought the document was impressive, had great ideas and did agood job of incorporating other groups that already exist on campus, but she said the work is not done.“This is a longer conversation; it’s not going to end with this plan,” said Ravi, who is also the vicepresident of facilitator training for SAPA and Co-President of Feminists in Action. “This is a really goodstart, but the issue merits more time.”As for moving forward, Diener said that IFC plans to meet with other student groups and has created anonline form where people can submit feedback anonymously.“Our ban was different than a lot of schools’ bans,” Diener said. “It was appropriate during this time totake a step back and reflect and establish our way forward, producing something tangible.”— By Sonam Vashi, Executive Editor and Stephen Fowler, Asst.
