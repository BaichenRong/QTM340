Orange Is the New Black (OITNB) actress Jackie Cruz relayed stories of immigrating from theDominican Republic and overcoming a severe car accident while speaking to Emory's 2017 graduatingseniors May 4 as the keynote speaker of Class Day.Cruz shared her story of hardship and success, from growing up as an aspiring performer in theDominican Republic to finding fame in New York, referring to herself as a "Hollywood Gypsy," which isalso the title of her 2010 EP. Cruz's life is particularly marked by a near-fatal car crash she was involvedin at 16, leaving her in a coma for three days and with countless broken bones and a metal plate in herhead."My dreams seemed impossible back then. I wanted to kill myself, but my mother said, 'Jackie you needto make it even more now. You have to inspire other people,' " she said in an interview with the Wheelbefore the event.Despite the serious content, Cruz kept her speech upbeat and entertaining. Her speech led the audiencethrough her climb in the performance world, from moving to Hollywood with her mom at 15 years old,later to Miami and finally New York.She ended her speech by advising audience members to follow their dreams, no matter how long it maytake.Cruz's story about her transition from the Dominican Republic was similar to the one she told an Emoryaudience at Culture Shock November 2015, recounting the sacrifices she made to follow her dreams,her accident, and her perseverance."It doesn't matter where you came from. It's doesn't matter what you look like. It's what inside thatcounts," Cruz said at Class Day. "If God put a passion in your soul, please don't put a timeline on yourdream because that's what you're meant to do."Marielle Cottrell (17B) said Cruz's advice was meaningful to her as she graduates from college."That was a good lesson for us â€” going out into the real world and thinking we know what we're going todo but in the end, we really don't," Cottrell said.At Class Day, Lynette Dixon (17C), Taryn Connelly (17N) and Lolade Oshin (17B) were presented withBoisfeuillet Jones Medals in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School ofNursing and Goizueta Business School, respectively.
