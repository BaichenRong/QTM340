She was held in Newton County Jail until she posted bail Mondaynight, which was held at $1,500.The Wheel was unable to reach Sakamoto for comment.Some students were not satisfied with the administration's response. "During this time students had noidea if it was okay for them to leave their rooms, go get food, use the bathroom," Oxford Collegesophomore Emmaleigh Calhoun said. "No one knew what was happening."Calhoun acknowledged that the EPD did its job, but expressed concern over the University's lack ofcommunication with the community."As I understand it, students outside of Oxford College have received no information regarding whatoccurred yesterday, which is almost as ridiculous as Oxford students going over 18 hours withoutinformation," she said.There was no lockdown or warning from the administration during these hours, according to Oxfordsophomore Thomas Lampeter. The administration "showed a lack of responsiveness and leadership,"he said.The statement from Emory University reads, "Emory University is committed to providing a safeenvironment for all community members and will take swift and appropriate action to maintain thesecurity of the campus community."Executive Digital Editor Stephen Fowler and Managing Editor Zak Hudak contributed reporting.
