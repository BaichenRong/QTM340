The Emory University Goizueta Business School partnered with the Coca-Cola Company to host lastweekend’s Coca-Cola Hackathon, which featured winning ideas geared towards changing the way thatusers interact with their music. One hundred and fifty students and professionals of various technicalskill levels and areas of interest gathered from multiple universities from across the country to engage inand collaborate on computer programming tasks.The winning team walked away with the opportunity to present his or her “hack,” or collaborativesoftware projects, to Coca-Cola and their partners, and up to $15,000 in prizes. Hackers were able toenter as individuals or on teams, and each participant or team was required to showcase at least twopartner application programming interfaces (API). With just six weeks to plan and execute the three-dayevent, the organizers successfully put together a program consisting of keynote speeches, API talkswith Spotify, Music Dealers and Misfit, presentations and API demos.Participants responded to the event with enthusiasm, saying that it benefitted the entire Emorycommunity. Hackathon participant and College sophomore Benjamin Bolte commented, “The culture [atEmory] is very much focused on pre-professionalism … but there’s a lot of stuff that Emory students cando here that doesn’t get represented. [Events] like this really help to create that culture.”It’s no secret that when someone thinks of computer science, Georgia Tech pops into the mind beforeEmory University. Even on Emory’s campus, the computer science program is overshadowed byEmory’s well-known pre-med and business programs. The Hackathon gives students an opportunity tohighlight computer science skills and entrepreneurship.Many participants see this event not only as a chance to win prize money and to network with prolificcomputer software companies, but also as a chance to learn from and connect with other students whoshare interests and skills.“My favorite part of hackathons, from the perspective of an organizer, is getting to meet awesome peoplewho are willing to give up a weekend to see what amazing things two days, their creativity, passion and asevere lack of sleep can produce,” the event’s equally sleep-deprived organizer Toby Gosselin said.Companies used the Hackathon as an opportunity to “put companies like Spotify in touch with the nextgeneration of developers,” Director of Developer Platforms at Spotify Paul Lamere said. From looking toadopt students’ ideas to awarding students the funds to develop their own programs, participatingcompanies certainly benefited from the Coca-Cola Hackathon.In listening to each developer’s presentations, companies gain a better understanding of what thisgeneration is currently looking for in new applications and gadgets. Most of the participants presentedhacks revolving around music, fitness and sustainability.At the end of the weekend, the participants presented their innovative ideas to the judges. Judgesevaluated the 20 hacks on the following criteria: innovation, problem solving, scalability and other merit.Justin Kim, Jennifer Ren, Summer Wu and Joan Shang, the winning team, created a platform that theycall “Heartbeat,” which gives customers the ability to customize a playlist to match the tempo of theirworkout and boost physical potential. They were awarded $10,000 worth of prizes, including PS4s,Parrot AR Drones and $7,000 in Amazon credit.A group of local professionals took second place with their platform, “Tru Chainz,” which streams thelyrics and gives music analysis of the current song. The judges awarded the group with GoPro Hero 4S,Sol Republic Gear and $2,500 in Amazon credit.Emory alum Hyo Yul Byun (‘15C) won third prize for his creation of music services that allow the usersto switch tracks based on time series data from any source such as weather and sine wave.One particular team of Emory hackers, including Fei Gao, Ben Chang, Lara Lu and Tony Wang, gainedparticular recognition from Spotify with its creation of a program that targets “hipsters.”The program compares playlists and connects the social group with little known songs that it predictsthat they would enjoy. Spotify awarded the team a Spotify Premium Package, a speak system, andmembership to the Atlanta Tech Village, an entrepreneurial technology community located in Buckhead.When asked to reflect on his experience working with Coca-Cola, Gosselin commented, “It is veryrewarding to see something you’ve put so much time and effort in actually happen and succeed.”Despite the short amount of time that the organizers and participants had to plan, they did succeed andfar surpass their own expectations — coming away from this weekend with fresh ideas and intensifiedpassion.— By Ashley Marcus, Contributing Writer
