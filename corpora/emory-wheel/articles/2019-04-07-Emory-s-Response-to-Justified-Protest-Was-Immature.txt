Since 1967, the Israeli government has demolished more than 50,000 buildings in the West Bank andEast Jerusalem, leaving roughly 140,000 Palestinians homeless. These are not disputed statistics. A fewdays ago, Emory Students for Justice in Palestine (ESJP) posted these statistics, along with a few otherstatements, onto the doors of Emory residence halls and off-campus housing. I'm agnostic regarding theactions of the Israeli government, but I'm repulsed by the community response to this form of passiveprotest.One would hope that such a protest would galvanize every concerned student and prompt much-neededdialogue about the difficult questions raised by the Israeli settlements and the occupation of Palestine.Instead, the response by many was to play the anti-Semitism card and petulantly treat the event as anattack on the Jewish community, destroying any hope of such discussion.It was an effective protest. Was it provocative? Yes, that's the point. But those who were offended by theprotest clearly misinterpreted it. Amazingly, even in the aftermath of this incident, it is the pro-Israelstudents who have claimed to be the ones open to dialogue, saying that these flyers are what has shutdown the conversation.If your bar for anti-Semitism is so low that this protest sets you off, offends you enough to keep you fromengaging in conversation or has brought you to tears, then you have no right to claim that you are theones open to dialogue.The flyers were not anti-Semitic, nor were they an attack on Emory's Jewish community. They were anattack on the actions of a foreign government. The flyers dispassionately outlined the actions of theIsraeli government while attempting to make the statistics feel personal. There was no violence; therewas no anti-Semitic rhetoric.There is real anti-Semitism out there, but when supporters of Israel pretend that criticism of the State ofIsrael like ESJP's flyers is an attack on Judaism, all they are doing is stifling discussion and making itharder to call out the real anti-Semites.The community response would have been appropriate if the flyers were actually anti-Semitic, but theywere not. The claims they make are, if not incontrovertible, arguable, and accepted by many. In fact, theUnited Nations condemned Israel's demolitions in 2004 — a vote from which Israel's strongest ally, theUnited States, abstained.Maybe there would be an argument if these flyers were placed only on the doors of Jewish students, butaccording to both ESJP and Dave Cohn, the director of Emory Hillel, they were not, the latter writing,"There has been no evidence that Jewish students were specifically targeted in the distribution of theseflyers," in an April 2 email. Investigations are ongoing, but so far, no red flags have been raised byEmory's Office of Student Conduct.The other claims on these flyers were more or less the same — if not simple, verifiable facts, thenmainstream opinions of legal scholars, like the assertion that such demolitions violate Article 53 of theGeneva Conventions and that Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. Are these claimscontroversial? Absolutely. Are there mainstream scholars on both sides of the issue? Yes.These issues are difficult to discuss, but that is precisely what makes them worth discussing.The only factual error in the whole document was the minor claim that the Israeli government referred tothis process as "Judaization," when in fact this is a term used by Israel's critics.But the fact that ESJP provoked such an outcry from these claims — claims that are not even thetoughest to grapple with — leaves me with little hope for the Emory community as a marketplace ofideas and of free exchange thereof.Last year, the Israeli Defense Forces killed 56 children and 234 adults, and this is a modest figure incomparison to the rest of the past two decades. Since 1967, the West Bank (which the vast majority ofcountries have recognized as belonging to Palestine) has been under military occupation by the Israeligovernment. In the past few decades, Israeli citizens have flocked to the West Bank to createsettlements in this territory, often at the expense of Palestinians — something even Alan Dershowitz, anavid supporter of the occupation itself, has condemned; and the growth of these settlements hasaccelerated under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rule during the past decade. Thirteenpercent of those living in the West Bank, de jure Palestinian land, are now Israeli citizens.To assert that a provocative protest about these issues constitutes an attack on one's community is adeplorable way to claim victim status and abdicate responsibility from having to answer for the actions ofthe State of Israel — the place that so many of the counter-protestors claim to love so dearly.How many past and current Emory students have casually bemoaned the hypersensitivity of students ofcolor, dismissing them as snowflakes for expressing discontent with the culture at Emory? How many ofthese same students have now rallied behind Emory Hillel and the Anti-Defamation League, the latterwhose director called the protests "offensive and intimidating"?In an April 2 Emory Hillel email, Cohn wrote that Hillel spent the day "wrangling with the challenges posedby such an action … defending the safety of our students from this intrusion on their privacy andsecurity." The letter closes reading, "in solidarity."In solidarity? A threat to safety and security? Take a step back for a minute. If you had read thatstatement out of context, you would think that someone had just painted swastikas on the doors ofEmory Hillel.The flyers were distributed to criticize the alleged human rights violations of a foreign government. Ifsomething this anodyne makes you feel unsafe, you are not fostering a community dedicated to freeinquiry and debate, the two values that ought to be most important on our college campus. But treatingthese flyers as if they constitute some threat to the safety and wellbeing of thousands of Emory studentssure is a convenient way of sidestepping an actual conversation about complex issues.These are discussions we need to have, but for that to happen, we must make a collective decision notto treat every provocative attack on Israeli policy — especially those devoid of any semblance of bigotry— as if it is anti-Semitic.University President Claire E. Sterk wrote in a statement, "I'm confident we will balance the need toprotect free speech and the security and dignity of all in our community." In the case at hand, the onlyway to balance these competing interests that leaves Emory with any claim to "upholding free speechand vigorous debate" is to encourage ESJP to continue their protests in whatever civil, nonviolent waythey intend to pursue them.There was no attack on the Jewish community by ESJP, but there was an attack on the virtue of opendialogue by various members of the Emory community.Grant Osborn (19C) is from Springfield, Ohio.Assistant Opinion Editor Zach Ball (21C) previously served as president of Emory Students for Justice inPalestine and was not involved in editing this op-ed.The post Emory's Response to Justified Protest Was Immature appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
