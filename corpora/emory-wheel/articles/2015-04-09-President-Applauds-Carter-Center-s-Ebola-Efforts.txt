Still, he said, the Center’s main focus lay outside ofpolitics.“The primary goal of the Carter Center … is in health care,” he said, describing the Center’s educatingLiberians on how to avoid contracting and spreading tropical diseases like Dracunculiasis, or guineaworm disease, which can be contracted through unclean drinking water. “We’ve been doing this for along time — 30 years now in fact.”“[Tropical diseases] are not always addressed by the public health system, because sometimes [publichealth officials] don’t even know they exist,” Carter said, calling Ebola a “neglected tropical disease.”When the outbreak began in March 2014 and other organizations were slow to respond, he said, theCarter Center’s involvement in Liberia proved an advantage.“[Ebola] was basically ignored by the World Health Organization [WHO], the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention [CDC], the local health organizations — it was ignored,” Carter said.But by that time, the Center had already begun training nurses for a mental health program in the countryled by his wife, Rosalynn, he said.“By the time March 2014 came along, 144 nurses had already been trained, so we decided to train themfor Ebola treatment,” Carter said. He added that, along with two other public health programs in Liberia,the Carter Center was well prepared for the crisis last year, and “it was natural that we gave our attentionto the problem of Ebola in Liberia.”Still, he noted that the WHO and the CDC had not declared the outbreak an emergency until late in thesummer of 2014.Throughout the lecture and ensuing question and answer session, Carter emphasized the importance ofeducating the citizens of affected countries, a key strategy of the Carter Center’s workers.He described informing the locals of the importance of staying away from the bodies of those who haddied of Ebola as one example of a major challenge in this area.“They had always revered the bodies of the deceased, so to have the bodies disposed of, when theywere normally touched or even kissed — that was a shock to them,” he said.When teaching Liberian citizens about guinea worm, he recalled, the Carter Center workers faced manyobstacles.“How do you teach people who can’t read and write, who don’t have radio or TV, what to do about guineaworm?” he asked. The answer: the organization workers drew cartoons of women drawing from pools.Those who strained the water for guinea worm eggs were shown healthy at the bottom of the cartoon.Those who didn’t strain the water were shown suffering the grotesque consequence of the disease — aguinea worm emerging from the person’s skin.Carter also cited the Liberians’ trust in the Carter Center workers — despite their mistrust in thecountry’s government — as an advantage in the organization’s efforts to educate them.“It was obvious to us that no one believed the directions and instructions that came out of Monrovia, andthat’s why we had to inform them,” Carter said. “We were the first ones who went into the [country’s]interior during [the] civil war. We were the first ones to have the elections. We had the confidence of thepeople.”Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, current president of Liberia, “invited the Carter Center to come in even before theEbola crisis really got started,” according to Carter.“We’ve never been experts on Ebola, we’ve never treated anyone with Ebola, but when our specialistscame in, the people listened,” he said.When discussing the United States’ response to the outbreak, Carter said “we handled it very poorlyhere — except at Emory.”He also recognized Liberian nursing student Fatu Kekula, who sat in the front row, for her work in savingthe lives of three family members afflicted with the virus before enrolling at the Nell Hodgson WoodruffSchool of Nursing this spring.After the talk — which was sponsored by the Institute of African Studies, the Institute for DevelopingNations and the School of Nursing — Kekula said she thought Carter “addressed all of the crises” butwished he had explained ways to address Liberia’s infrastructural needs in more detail. She specificallysaid she had hoped Carter would touch on ways to improve Liberia’s education system, health system,health facilities construction and the health education for communities and professional health workers.Jessica Frye, a first-year Laney Graduate School student who attended the talk, said she thought seeingCarter speak was ”amazing” and “a great opportunity,” though she added that she wished Kekula hadbeen able to voice her experiences.“If she would’ve spoken, it would have been more important,” Frye said. “What [Carter] did was great andeverything, but I would really have liked to hear [Kekula’s] perspective.”
