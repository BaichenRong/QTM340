Former U.S. President and Emory Distinguished Professor Jimmy Carter, who is known for his activepost-presidency work in human rights and peacemaking, discussed leadership and overcoming failure atthe Carter Center on Feb. 13.Carter advised a group of about 300 Oxford College students that overcoming the fear of failure is crucialto success. Though the 39th president failed to secure a second term in the White House, he said hemade the best of the setback by starting his work at the Carter Center.Similarly, he asked the audience members to re-conceptualize how they viewed past events, suggestingthat few outcomes could truly be labeled as a "success" or "failure."Carter also pointed to the 1987 Camp David Accords as an example of a "partial success." Though hefailed at achieving a definite peace for the Palestinians, he brokered a peace treaty between Egypt andIsrael.Carter's advice about dealing with failure came after a discussion about the importance of learning toovercome setbacks to be an effective leader. Oxford College Dean Douglas Hicks, who also spoke atthe event, said Carter's work with the Carter Center often qualified him as "the most successful expresident."Carter urged students to aim high. He said the Carter Center never would have achieved its currentsuccesses if its 1988 International Task Force for Disease Eradication had set more conservative goals."We adopted five diseases in the world to eradicate knowing that we couldn't succeed at [eradicating] allof them, but we've gotten very close," Carter said.Carter concluded that his optimistic mindset, along with ongoing support from his wife, Rosalynn Carter,allows him to continue working despite temporary setbacks."I think what we've done at the Carter Center equals what I did as president," Carter concluded.When asked about the other qualities of a good leader, Carter emphasized the importance of staying trueto moral principles, rather than focusing purely on public opinion. For example, Carter said he could havedeclared war with Iran to win re-election, but he did not want to sacrifice his belief in peace for the sake ofanother term in office.The post Carter Tells Oxford College Students to Aim High in the Face of Failure appeared first on TheEmory Wheel.
