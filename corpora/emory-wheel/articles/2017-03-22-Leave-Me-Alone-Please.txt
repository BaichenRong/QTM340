You are sitting alone in your room enjoying a moment of solitude when a friend barges in unannouncedand begins monologuing about their overwhelming workload. Or worse, they tell you about the hilariousBuzzfeed quiz they just took.For most, this scenario is not only undesirable — it's unacceptable. So why does that kind of intrusionsuddenly become O.K. when it's happening on your phone?In the digital world, our mental space is constantly threatened by excessive communication. Continuousstreams of email and working late hours outside the office can lead to mental health issues such asanxiety and internet addiction. Any college student can attest that frequent stimulation from smartphonesis unhelpful and makes for unproductive and inefficient work.But now, the pressure of maintaining constant connection online is no longer limited to professionalrelationships. Online culture normalizes the erasure of personal space in personal relationships too, andthat needs to stop.What we rarely admit is that notifications on our smartphones often feel like invaders, marching into ourrealities and demanding our attention. A text from a friend feels rude when we are obligated to replyinstantly with the right emojis. Even a useful email becomes counterproductive when we feel obligated todrop what we're doing and reply immediately.The problem lies not in the ease of communicating with smartphones, which is central to modernworkplaces and relationships, but in the culture that arises from it. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it'snot an excuse to get rid of the self-isolation that allows us to focus and be creative.In professional settings, we are expected to be available at any time to quickly edit a Google doc or replyto a group message. Likewise, instead of planning times to meet up with friends, we are expected to beprepared to reply to a friendly message or video chat with little warning. And in case we don't feelanxious enough already, there are always "Read receipts."When physical space is invaded, the body has a visceral response: fight or flight. Even the mostextroverted people need mental and emotional space to function, and when we are sociallyoverwhelmed, anxiety triggers a similar mechanism — the desire to just turn the phone off completely, orbetter yet, throw it out the window and never reply to a group message again.Physical distance used to be a valid excuse for cutting off social interaction, but when the threat iscoming from the device in your back pocket, the personal space we all need is much harder to defend.So how do we redraw the boundaries without ostracizing ourselves? As is often true, the best defense isa good offense. Start by asking "is this a good time to talk?" before delving into a heavy conversation. Ifyou really need an immediate response, just say please. And for all of our sanity, take the time to thinkbefore imposing the trivial details of your life onto everyone you know. Just stop, breathe and send it toyour mother instead.Madeline Lutwyche is a College freshman from Baltimore, Maryland.
