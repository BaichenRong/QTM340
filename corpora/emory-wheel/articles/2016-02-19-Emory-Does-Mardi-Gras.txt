In fact, the city of New Orleans has become almost synonymous with the festivities. When Iwas little, I heard about Mardi Gras and its lavish carnivals and celebrations from my parents, but it wasnot until this year's festivities that I actually experienced the event for myself — and it certainly lives up tothe hype. People of all ages visit the Creole city, specifically Bourbon Street, for the festival and the goodmemories that come with it.Thanks to Emory's "close" proximity to New Orleans, many students travel down south for the weekendto celebrate with their friends and thousands of strangers. What makes Mardi Gras so special?According to College sophomore Areeta Shah, she decided to take the seven-hour road trip because itwas always a dream of hers. "I went to Mardi because I saw all my friends were going and having sucha great time in prior years, and I wanted to experience it for myself," Shah said. Shah noted theexcitement of "being in a crowd of people that are equally as excited to have this experience" as a majorpart of her love for Mardi Gras.To get to New Orleans, Emory students drove down with friends, took public buses or flew to make aquick and easy trip. For me and many of my close friends, the drive down to NOLA was part of theexperience.Yes, seven hours in a car driving through Alabama and Mississippi is not the most entertaining andgorgeous drive, but it was worth it. Airlines and hotels are notorious for driving up the prices of flights androoms around the time of Mardi Gras, so driving and paying $25 to fill up a tank of gas was definitely themore economic option.College junior Rachel Klein decided to return to Mardi Gras for a second time because "it is one of themost fun weekends — people come from all over, including [her] friends from other colleges. Everyonethere is so happy and carefree, making it easy to have a good time." Klein also said she believes that herexperience was more enjoyable this year because she is now 21 and was able to visit the famous PatO'Briens Bar.College sophomore Tahira Saalik said that Emory students go to Mardi Gras because "It's a greatexperience with friends, and New Orleans is relatively close by for the trip." Although Saalik was not ableto go this year, she intends to visit the city in the near future.The tradition of Emory students traveling to New Orleans for Mardi Gras has extended even tofreshmen; however, Shah notes that it may not be the best option to go during your first year at Emory. "Ithink that freshman year is not the time to go because I was still trying to settle into a new lifestyle and itis very difficult on Bourbon Street to get into bars underage."College freshman Carly Lapidus does have intentions to attend Mardi Gras in the future, but says herplans did not work out this year. "I didn't go to Mardi Gras this year because I didn't think that a lot offreshmen would go," Lapidus said. "By the time I thought about going, it was too late to make plans orreservations. It definitely looks like a lot of fun roaming around Bourbon Street and celebrating withfriends, so I plan on going in the future."With rising prices and time away from campus, some students may not see Mardi Gras as a worthwhileexperience. Shah said that she feels the only downside to going to Mardi Gras was that "Emory literallymoved from one state to another; however, I will never regret going because I loved the energy and spiritof the festival."In terms of my own experiences, I can agree with Shah on many of her points. It was a desire of mine tomake it down to NOLA at least once during my time at Emory, and the weekend did not disappoint. Ienjoyed my time traversing down Bourbon Street and interacting with friends and strangers who all werethere to celebrate and enjoy themselves. Getting to walk down Bourbon Street and seeing plenty ofpeople dressed in the most outrageous, yet fun clothing was very inspirational — Mardi Gras is a time tosimply let go and have fun.
