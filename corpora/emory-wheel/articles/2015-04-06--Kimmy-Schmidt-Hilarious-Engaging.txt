While many college students dream of living in New York City after graduation, the transition may bemore difficult for some than for others. However, it likely won’t be as challenging as it is for KimmySchmidt, a 29-year-old woman who must adjust to New York City after living in a cult.The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is an original Netflix series that follows the story of Kimmy Schmidt(Ellie Kemper), who is rescued from a doomsday cult after living in an underground bunker for 15 years.The comedy follows Schmidt as she transitions to a new life in New York City, working as a nanny for awealthy socialite.Created by Tina Fey (“30 Rock,” “Saturday Night Live”) and Robert Carlock (“30 Rock”),the 13-episodeseries premiered on Netflix on March 6, 2015.Despite the comedic prowess of the two writers, the first fifteen minutes of the first episode left meunsure (though certainly amused). The show seemed so ridiculous that it was unclear whether it couldsucceed as more than a show merely with absurd characters and a great deal of funny jokes. However,as the series progressed, I realized that there was more to the “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” — in bothcharacters and plot.While the show does include some characters that seem to fit stereotypes, from the gay best friend whoaspires to Broadway fame, Titus Andromenon (Tituss Burgess), to the elderly, eccentric landlady, LillianKaushtupper (Carol Kane) and the ditzy Manhattan socialite, Jacqueline Voorhees (Jane Krakowksi), theseries manages to bring complexity to each character and elicit empathy from their dynamism.Photo Courtesy of NBC NetflixThe audience gets the chance to watch Titus try to survive as an artist in New York City, Lillian fight tosave her neighborhood and Jacqueline struggle with her relationship with her husband. While all of theirdifficulties are portrayed in humorous manners, the underlying realities of their troubles are impossible toignore.However, it is Kimmy who is especially compelling — rightfully so, as the titular character. Her naivety,though off-putting at times, is also what drives her motivation to change the world.Of course, this is due not only to the writing of Fey and Carlock, but also to Kemper’s excellentperformance. As Kimmy, she brings a quirkiness beyond that of her days in “The Office” as Erin Hannon(a naive receptionist). She plays the perfect balance of innocence and wisdom; through many momentsof cluelessness, at times, we get the sense that she has a wisdom beyond her years.In addition to the the complexity of each character, the comedic expertise of Fey and Carlock shinesthrough in the writing.The theme song is reminiscent of the viral video “Bedroom Intruder.” It’s a remixed song of the newsinterview of a neighbor who witnesses Kimmy’s rescue from the underground bunker.“They alive,dammit!” the song proclaims. “It’s a miracle!”From the theme song to the ridiculousness of the characters and situation (only these two wouldintroduce an underground doomsday cult in a comedy), the “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” will easilybring its audience laughter.However, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” does not merely function as a comedy. While, at first glance,the show’s cast of characters seems so bizarre that it would be impossible for the series to address anyserious topics, part of the genius of the show is in its ability to create characters and situations that areboth funny and relevant in today’s world. One such instance is when Titus walks around New York Citydressed as a werewolf.“I got treated better as a werewolf than I ever did as a black man,” he says, in a simple off-hand remark.“That’s messed up.”Photo Courtesy of NBC NetflixWhile his statement is clearly funny, it also gives the audience the chance to recognize the truth in hiswords — the reality of the potential dangers of being a black male in today’s society, particularlyconsidering the recent cases of police brutality toward black males.Another instance is an exchange between Kimmy and a construction worker, who catcalls her in the city.While her obvious lack of understanding creates a humorous situation, later in the series, we learn thather naivety forced the worker to confront his own catcalling tendencies, affecting real change in hishabits.While this is not to say that we should dress as werewolves in New York City or confront constructionworkers in an attempt to solve all of the world’s problems, perhaps it is in the ridiculous and comedic thatwe can best tackle the realities and truths of the world — the “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” in all itshilarity and quirkiness, certainly succeeds in doing just that.-Julia Munslow, Assistant Arts & Entertainment Editor
