"[Emory] is strictlymedicine and with the way medicine has been going over the last few years and has been integrated intobasketball, it's important that here in Atlanta the team uses [Emory] as a resource."The Hawks hope to break ground on the new facility at its Brookhaven, Ga. location this summer afterthe National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft and hope to have it ready for the 2017 NBA season.Upgrading the practice facilities has been a long-term objective of Hawks principal owner Tony Resslersince the first time he toured the current facility."When we became owners, one of our top priorities was to provide the resources necessary to build aworld-class training facility â€” a key element of being a first-class franchise that consistently competes atthe highest level. We are thrilled with the partnership that [Hawks CEO Steven Koonin] and [Hawks HeadCoach Mike Budenholzer] have forged with [Director of the Emory Orthopaedics and Spine Center andChief Medical Officer of the Emory University Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital Scott Boden] and theEmory team in developing a new facility that will be at the forefront of how professional teams approachintegrating sports medical technology in their training centers," Ressler said in the Hawks press release.Previous NBA teams have already developed similar partnerships, including the Cleveland Cavalierswith the Cleveland Clinic and the Minnesota Timberwolves with the Mayo Clinic.However, the Hawks' new facility is the first of its kind in that it will be the first to co-locate with bothpartners. The Hawks will move all Basketball Operations personnel to the facility, and Emory will movetheir entire team of sports medicine doctors, surgeons and specialists. Thirty thousand square feet of thefacility will be dedicated solely to Emory.Emory sports medicine doctors will see their patients in the new facility, allowing patients to be treatedwhere their favorite players are being treated, according to the press release."Emory Healthcare has built outstanding orthopaedics services over the past decade, and we areexcited to continue to grow this area and work closely with the Atlanta Hawks," President, CEO andChairman of the Board of Emory Healthcare Jonathan S.
