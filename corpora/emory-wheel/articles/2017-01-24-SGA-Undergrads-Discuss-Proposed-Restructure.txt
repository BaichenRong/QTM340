The 50th Legislature of the Student Government Association (SGA) discussed the proposed SGArestructure in an undergraduate-only meeting following its legislative meeting and confirmed twoappointments, one to the Constitutional Council and one to the SGA President's Cabinet by passing twobills during its Monday meeting.After the meeting adjourned, SGA President and College senior Max Zoberman led an undergraduateonly discussion on the possible structure of the undergraduate SGA should the bill pass in theUniversity-wide referendum.SGA College-wide Representative and College junior William Palmer presented the proposedundergraduate governing structure to the undergraduate legislators in anticipation of the referendum.The proposed governing structure called for a 10-person legislature composed of a Collegerepresentative from each class; a junior and senior Goizueta Business School representative; a juniorand senior Nursing representative; one freshman; and a sophomore Oxford College representative. Oneex-officio Graduate Student Government Association (GSGA) member would also sit on theundergraduate legislature.Palmer invited undergraduate legislators to provide feedback on the proposed structure. Somelegislators expressed concerns that 10 legislators would not be enough to represent the diverse campus.Vice President for Alumni Relations and Goizueta Business School junior John Baker said that havingonly 10 elected positions would diminish the "undergraduate experience" because fewer undergraduatestudents would have the opportunity to participate in SGA.Palmer said that the limited number of legislators would force those who obtain a position to be moreactive, pointing out that only two undergraduate legislators — Zoberman and Executive Vice Presidentand Business School junior Gurbani Singh — wrote bills last semester."This [new structure] fosters a much more active role that each legislator has to take on," Palmer said."Every legislator is going to deliver a legislative report. This increases accountability and activity."Zoberman, Singh, SGA Chief of Staff and College senior Julianna Joss, Greenbaum, GSGA VicePresident, Laney graduate student Mary Herrick and all of the SGA advisors were involved in drafting theproposal, according to Zoberman.Bill 50sl20 called for the confirmation of Emory School of Law second-year Lorenia Lopez toConstitutional Council justice on the grounds that she has "the relevant experience and significantinvolvement with organizations dedicated to building an inclusive and supportive community." Lopez willhear and decide questions of constitutionality on any University action that affects student groups.Bill 50sl21 nominated Goizueta Business School senior Christopher Lam for attorney general. The roleincludes advising SGA and all chartered organizations on the constitutionality of their actions.SGA passed both bills unanimously.Bill 50s818, which requested $2,000 for the expansion of the African Student Association's "Taste ofAfrica" event, was tabled until next week's meeting because SGA Vice President of Finance andGoizueta Business School senior Jason Yu said there was not enough information to vote on it yet.Michelle Lou contributed reporting.
