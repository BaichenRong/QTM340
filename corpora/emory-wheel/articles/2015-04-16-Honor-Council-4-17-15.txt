The student copied hisroommate’s responses, which the course professor noted while grading the assignment. Whilecollaboration was permitted, the student’s roommate said he did not know the student had planned tocopy his responses. The student received a two-year mark on his record, a full letter grade deduction inthe course and a zero on the assignment.* For a short writing assignment, a freshman in a lower level social science course copied a fewsentences verbatim from a website without using quotation marks. After typing the phrases into a quickonline search, the professor soon found the original text, which had been referenced in the student’sbibliography. As an international student, he claimed that he did not know that direct speech should beplaced in quotations but acknowledged that he had committed plagiarism by U.S. standards. The HonorCouncil required the student to complete an educational program and gave him a one-year mark on hisrecord and zero on the paper but decided that he would have the opportunity to replace the grade afterwriting another paper on the same subject.* While working on a paper about a contemporary author for a lower level humanities course, a juniorstudent contacted the author and included some of his communication with the author in her paper. Theprofessor noted a difference in the student’s language and ideas while grading the paper and consultedthe student, who said he didn’t know the content of his conversations with the author should have beencited. Though the student argued that he supplemented the author’s ideas and claims discussed duringthe unreferenced conversation, he received a failing grade in the course and a two-year mark on hisrecord. Convinced that the student did not intend to plagiarize the discussion material, an appeal panelmaintained the two-year mark but gave the student a zero on the assignment instead of an F in thecourse.The following reports are real cases adjudicated by the Emory College Honor Council.
