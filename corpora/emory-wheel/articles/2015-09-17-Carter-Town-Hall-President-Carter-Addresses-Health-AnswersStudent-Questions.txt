"Emory University has been one of the highlights of my life," Former United States President and EmoryUniversity Distinguished Professor Jimmy Carter said Wednesday night at the 34th annual Carter TownHall Meeting.Carter addressed topics from the death penalty and Syria to his favorite hobby (fly fishing) over thenearly hour-long event that was focused on student inquiries.University President James W. Wagner presented Carter with the President's Medal, the 10th of its kind,to honor his work in advancing human understanding and peace prospects.As he approached the podium, Carter was greeted with enthusiastic applause from first- year studentswedged between bleachers as he prepared to consider their questions, which were either submitted onpaper before the event or on Twitter. He prefaced this session, however, by briefing the audience on hishealth condition.Carter was diagnosed with melanoma this summer and will continue to undergo MRI testing, he said.Nevertheless, he will embrace any medical progress that can ameliorate his condition; he plans tocontinue to act as a trustee and partner with Emory and as a leader in organizations such as Habitat forHumanity.On Aug. 20, Carter announced in a press conference that the melanoma had spread to four spots in hisbrain.Carter proceeded to take questions, to which he routinely responded with anecdotes about human rightsand an emphasis on the global effects of work on equality. The key element in establishing human rights,Carter said, is to maintain our country's peace. He emphasized his hope that the United States wouldsolidify itself as a generous country that can aid other nations in times of human and environmentalconflict.Carter's idols include Anwar Sadat and Nelson Mandela, primarily for their unwavering generosity.Carter addressed human rights in a different facet when responding to a student's question regardingmass incarceration and its relationship to racial inequality."We have a destitute and very improper and almost an illegal system of justice in this country," he said.He added that the number of people in prison has multiplied by seven since he was a governor inGeorgia and that the cost of keeping someone in prison yearly exceeds that of an Emory education.Carter took another question with a smile, and acknowledged an audible interest from the audience."What is the first thing you say to your wife in the morning and the last thing you say before you go tosleep?" a student asked.Carter recalled the morning that he forgot his wife's birthday. He wrote her a note on a small card, whichread, "Rose, for your birthday I have resolved to give you any wish that you have."His wife responded that she would like a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice delivered to her everymorning — by Carter. "We've been together now 69 years," he said.Carter said he and his wife have two rules: to give each other space and to resolve any argumentsbefore going to sleep. They read the Bible every night before bed.."Most of the time we do that in Spanish," he said. "Just to practice our second language."Those personal and emotional anecdotes made the event worthwhile, College freshman ChelseaLeversedge said. She identified Carter's personal recollections as the best parts of the program andexpressed gratitude for Carter's candor."It was so neat to have the opportunity to be in the same room as a former president," she said.Among his responses to closing questions, Carter advised students to become fully aware of theircurrent freedom.He said that students do not live a day without encountering others' ideas, which they can either acceptor reject — and either way use for the betterment of humanity."You have, at that time, the most flexible possible opportunity to shape your personal future and thefuture of those who can be influenced by you," he said.
