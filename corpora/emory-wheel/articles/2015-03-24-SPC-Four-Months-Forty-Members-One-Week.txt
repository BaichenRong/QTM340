Photo by Hagar Elsayed. | Photo EditorOver the past four months, 40 Student Programming Council (SPC) members leveraged theirentertainment industry connections and a large and undisclosed budget to put together this year’sDooley’s Week.These 40 members, armed with a chunk of every student’s contribution to Emory’s Student Activity Fee(SAF), receive the budget go-ahead from the Student Government Association (SGA) every year.SPC cannot publish their budget, as this would hinder negotiations and in some cases violate contractswith entertainment contacts, according to the council’s members.With the SGA’s stamp of approval, SPC members spent months booking artists through industryconnections and research. While the members have been unable to gather student input due to fears ofraising student expectations too high, as well as the constraints of the negotiation process, they areattempting this year to integrate student responses and are always subject to administrative oversight,according to SPC members.This concert isn’t for me specifically — this is a concert for all of Emory. -SPC Dooley’s Week Co-Chairand B-School senior Austin FussThis year, the SPC Speakers Committee landed former “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) writer JohnMulaney for Thursday night’s Dooley’s Week comedy show in the Glenn Memorial auditorium. For theculmination of Dooley’s Week events, the Dooley’s Frolics and Dooley’s Ball Committees chose rapperJ. Cole and house music duo The Knocks, respectively.They’ve brought performers like Kendrick Lamar, Passion Pit, OneRepublic, B.o.B and Chance theRapper to McDonough Field in the past five years, along with stand-up comedians Amy Schumer,Hannibal Buress and Rob Riggle.Difficulties in Gathering Student InputSPC, according to its members, has struggled to find ways to incorporate student input into theirdecisions but is moving to gather more feedback following the events.In terms of gauging student preferences prior to the Council’s events, SPC Speakers Chair and GoizuetaBusiness School junior Max Mayblum said the Council has tried surveys, only to receive outlandishrecommendations.“We do a lot of surveying on Facebook,” he said. “It’s a good starting point, but you’ll get people onFacebook suggesting the most world-renowned performers, which is not really feasible.”SPC Dooley’s Week Co-Chair and B-School senior Austin Fuss stressed that he does his best to keepthe whole campus in mind when deciding on a performer.“This concert isn’t for me specifically — this is a concert for all of Emory,” Fuss said. He added, inreference to the choice of J. Cole for Dooley’s Frolics, “I personally am not a fan of rap.”Although requested by some students, a pre-decision vote would not be possible as it would potentiallysacrifice SPC’s ability to bring performers to campus, according to Band Party Co-Chair and B-Schoolsenior Jon Goldman.Solidifying the arrangement, according to Goldman, can take months — the process of booking J. Cole,for example, began in December.“Therefore, when unforeseen opportunities arise it can be difficult to incorporate student input as evenwaiting 24 hours may cost us the chance of booking such an artist,” Goldman wrote in an email to theWheel. “Once negotiations begin with our artists, we are contractually obligated to not release the nameof the artist until a set date specified in the contract.”Fuss also emphasized the risk of publicizing the names of possible acts, as SPC could potentially raisestudents’ hopes for a certain performer and then have to inform the entire student body that those plansfell through. Still, he said that SPC “wouldn’t be opposed to” a survey on students’ general musicalpreferences.As for getting a sense of student approval after the event, Fuss said, “We try to get as much feedback aswe can, through the surveys we send out, and people often email us and give us feedback.”However, he added, those who go out of their way to give feedback via email are generally not doing soto commend SPC.“When people reach out to us it’s generally like, ‘Oh, here’s a way you can improve,’” he said.Even after SPC announces performers’ names or hosts an event, student feedback is something SPCcould and continues to improve, Mayblum said. He pointed to the 100-plus Facebook shares of SPC’sJohn Mulaney announcement as a solid indicator of student approval.“We definitely could put out some more formal surveys,” Mayblum said. He also suggested that SPCcould provide a business ratings or customer service review system to event attendees as they exit.Mayblum added that SPC will begin using card readers at events for the first time this year. Though SPCwon’t receive information on the specific identities of those who attend the events, the Council will be ableto see information such as the attendee’s school and year, which Mayblum said SPC can use to get anidea of which audiences it needs to better engage.How It’s Possible: The SPC BudgetNeither SPC nor SGA makes SPC’s budget public, and the other University-Wide Organizations’ (UWO)budgets remain undisclosed as well, according to SGA President and College junior Jon Darby. SGAdoes not describe the budget in dollar amounts at its public meetings, according to SGA Vice Presidentof Finance and College senior Patrick O’Leary. SPC members cited contractual obligations andnegotiating needs as reasons for not disclosing their budget.When asked whether SPC considered making the budget public, Fuss said. “I can definitely see bothsides of that, but no, I don’t know of any plans to do that at this time.”The SPC budget amount approved by SGA comes from the UWO account, a portion of total revenue theSGA receives from the SAF, according to O’Leary.Each actively enrolled University student pays $184 for the annual SAF. The UWO account is 76 percentof another account of the SAF revenue called the University-Wide Distribution. Different divisions, suchas the College, the School of Medicine and Candler School of Theology, contribute varying portions oftheir SAF to this distribution.SGA recently increased the SAF from $178 to $184 annually and adjusted the percentages of divisions’contributions to the University-Wide Distribution.This change will take effect for the 2015-2016 year.Each year, SGA determines what portion of the UWO account will be dedicated to SPC for the followingacademic year while considering the needs of the other UWOs, according to O’Leary.For its yearly budget, the SPC treasurer submits the group’s desired amount of funding to the SGA.SGA’s vice president of finance, UWO treasurer and SGA Finance Committee must approve therequested funding, according to O’Leary. The SGA vice president of finance, UWO treasurer and SGAFinance Committee must do so for all UWOs, which in addition to SPC includes the Media Council, theClub Sports Council, Student Legal Services and Outdoor Emory Organization. According to O’Leary, heis currently in the process of ironing out SPC’s budget for the 2015-2016 year.The budget allocations to different UWOs, O’Leary added, “almost always have to be weaned down” andare primarily based on how much UWO account money is available.Within SPC, the president and treasurer decide how to divide the budget among different SPCcommittees based on the costs of past performers brought to Emory by each committee, according tomembers.The Council splits its budget between the Dooley’s Week Committee, Band Party Committee, SpeakersCommittee, SPC Beyond Committee, Special Events Committee and Homecoming Committee,according to SPC Graduate Adviser and Interim Director for Student Leadership Jill Camper. Leftovermoney, she added, goes to additional non-concert events.The SGA vice president of finance must approve the council’s transactions, as they do for transactionsof other UWOs, according to SGA members. The SGA vice president of finance can deny organizations’transactions if they violate the SGA Finance Code or University Policy; but according to Darby, this isvirtually never the case for SPC.“Paying for a performer does not violate the SGA Finance Code, so we would automatically approve thetransaction,” Darby said. According to O’Leary, this “automatic” approval doesn’t warrant his review,regardless of choice or cost.The SPC’s budget allocations and expenditures, which also are not public, are approved by Camper, theSPC president and the SPC treasurer, according to Camper.Camper added that leftover funds SPC did not spend on Homecoming Week and Dooley’s Week go to“a variety of events each year outside of concerts,” such as last October’s Halloween-themed event“Scream on the Green,” last April’s “Puppypalooza” event co-sponsored with the animal-friendlyvolunteer group Pawsitive Outreach and a March 2014 “5K Retro Run” race.How Oxford Does ItOxford College’s version of SPC, the Student Activities Committee (SAC), uses a pre-event planningsurvey, according to SAC Graduate Advisor Judy Sun.“SAC surveys Oxford students for feedback after larger, annual events and uses that information toinform the programming and planning the following year,” Sun wrote in an email to the Wheel.She added that, unlike Emory’s SPC, SAC uses both verbal input from Oxford students who speak withSAC members during the planning period and “preferences for genre and artist are also surveyed to helpdetermine the spring concert artist during Spirit Week.”Though the SAC, which receives 60 to 100 applications annually and currently consists of 24 students,does not publish its own budget and expenditures, SAC presents its budget and expenditures to Oxford’sSGA at the SGA’s public meetings, at which SGA often publicly modifies the SAC’s budget.SPC Knows People Who Know PeopleSPC’s entertainment industry connections have accumulated over the years and rely on past andpresent members’ networking abilities, according to SPC members.According to Mayblum, like the other SPC chairs, each speakers chair, who coordinates comedy actsfor Dooley’s Week and Homecoming Week, as well as various SPC-hosted speaker series, passes thecontact information of around 10 agents down from chair to succeeding chair. (Around 150 studentsapply for membership each year, according to Camper, and 12 to 15 are accepted.)“[The agents] give us a quick list of who’s on their roster, I look at how this fits into the budget, and then Ido a quick look-around, like ‘how will this speaker serve the community?’” Mayblum said. He added thathe conducts research on the listed comedians’ career states — for example, Mulaney’s new showpiloted last fall, and he is currently travelling the country on a comedy tour.Mayblum also said he pays attention to whether performers will be in or near Atlanta during or aroundDooley’s Week. As a stop on many entertainers’ U.S. tours, he said, the city of Atlanta itself attracts bothhigh-profile comedians and musicians alike.“There’s a lot of negotiation,” Mayblum said. He added that he begins by picking favored comedians fromthe agents’ lists and calling the agents directly to offer a price with his committee budget in mind. Theagent then talks to the performer or the performer’s manager.While Mayblum — as SPC speakers chair — presides over the choice of comedian, Fuss, one of thetwo SPC Dooley’s Week chairs, oversees the booking and decision making process for the musicians.“The Band Party chairs have the final say [over committee members’ choices] — they reach out to theagents,” Fuss said. “We give [committee members] our input, how we felt about each option.”After the chairs have settled on the two musicians — in this case, J. Cole and The Knocks — and acomedian — John Mulaney — Camper, the Council’s advisor, gives her approval, according to SPCmembers.Camper wrote in an email to the Wheel that her goal is not to choose the artist, but to help SPC students“see the big picture and think through everything” during the planning process.“Once we have talked through everything, including many risk management conversations, we moveforward with extending an offer,” Camper wrote. “I have rarely told SPC ‘no’ — my goal is always to getto a ‘yes.’”While Camper mentioned keeping the Emory Police Department up-to-date on SPC’s finalized plans,Goldman, who along with Band Party Co-Chair and Business School senior Adam Bates, reaches out tomusicians’ agents, said SPC members even have to apply for “proper permitting” from DeKalb Countybefore hosting a large-scale concert event.“Oversight is especially important when we consider the feasibility and risk of a concert of such a largescale,” Goldman wrote in an email to the Wheel. “No actions are made by SPC without approval by allnecessary parties.”Camper, Mayblum said, “is there with us the entire way.”“She’s involved in a lot of it herself,” he said, adding that Camper also connects SPC to entertainers’agents by attending various networking events throughout the year.“When she saw John Mulaney on the list, she suggested strongly that I pursue him.”The entire process, according to Camper, is extremely variable from year to year.“Sometimes we put out an offer [to a manager or agent] and confirm [the performance date] within aweek, and other years we are going back and forth with agents for months,” Camper wrote in an email tothe Wheel. “Pricing, scheduling, routing and availability all play a role, in addition to SPC gauging whichartists would be most successful on campus.”Goldman agreed, adding that some performance bookings require only “a few communications to securean artist and agree on a price,” while sometimes SPC negotiates with agents for several months beforeagreeing on a price.“This is always a negotiation process,” he wrote. “I believe SPC has been very successful in using itslimited resources to bring the best talent possible.”Who Is SPC?Any University student — graduate or undergraduate — can apply for SPC membership in September,according to the group’s website and Facebook page. SPC publicizes its application through socialmedia every year, counting down the minutes up to the deadline on Facebook, as it did in September2014.The candidates are evaluated on their experience in event planning, creativity, teamwork abilities,availability, how they would contribute to SPC’s diversity and their awareness of what’s happening oncampus, according to SPC’s website.According to its website, SPC members “will deepen their appreciation for diversity and understand thecreativity that can arise when diverse viewpoints exist and are openly shared,” as well as “value diverseadditions to the council through recruitment.”By maintaining a group of varying interests and tastes within SPC, according to Camper, the Council hasdeveloped outreach efforts over the years to both increase and diversify its applicant pool.Two recruitment officers within SPC are responsible for reaching out to Campus Life offices like theOffice of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Life, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Servicesand the Office of International Student Life, according to Camper. These two members are alsoresponsible for advertising the SPC application in freshman residence halls and to campus organizationslike Emory PRIDE, Indian Cultural Exchange and Volunteer Emory.Once SPC accepts a dozen or so new members from a pool of around 150 applicants in a given year,these two recruitment members are responsible for their training, according to Camper. Still, she addedthat “there is always room for improvement.”- By Lydia O’NealCorrection (3/24 at 11:56 a.m.): Paragraph 12 under the subhead “How It’s Possible: SPC’s Budget”incorrectly stated that the council’s budget is allocated among Dooley’s Week Committee, Band PartyCommittee and Speakers Committee.
