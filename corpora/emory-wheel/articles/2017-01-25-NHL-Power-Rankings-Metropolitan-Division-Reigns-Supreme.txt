Joining this elite trio are the Minnesota Wild and San JoseSharks, who claim the fourth and fifth spots respectively.1.) Washington Capitals (32-9-6)Goals have been plentiful in the nation's capital. The Capitals seem to score three or more goals withease in each of their match-ups. Just this week the Capitals piled seven goals on St. Louis Blues'goaltender Jake Allen and four on Dallas Stars' goaltender Kari Lehtonen.

Competing in Dallas Saturday Jan. 21,the Capitals had more difficulty holding off their opponent. The game was knotted at three goals apiece inovertime, when forward Jay Beagle handled a pass from forward Evgeny Kuznetsov.

Riding thetails of terrific offensive performances, the Capitals struck again Monday Jan. 23, scoring six goals tobeat Carolina 6-1. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov scored two goals in the game and Kuznetsov marked agoal and a primary assist.2.) Pittsburgh Penguins (30-11-5)The top of the power rankings is a familiar spot for the defending Stanley Cup champions the PittsburghPenguins.

Take the Penguins' victory against the Montreal Canadiens andtheir star goaltender Carey Price Wednesday Jan. 18. Four players scored for Pittsburgh, includingdefenseman Olli Maatta, who scored his first goal of the season. Penguins' goalie Matt Murray wassteady in the net, yielding only one goal.

Forward Conor Sheary was a leading player for the Penguins in the gameand scored two goals, one of which was on a silky smooth no-look behind-the-back pass from SidneyCrosby.3.) Columbus Blue Jackets (32-10-4)The Blue Jackets had a turbulent set of games since their historic 16-game win streak that crumbledearlier this month.
