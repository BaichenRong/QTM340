Inaddition to masala chai, Kaldi's serves chocolate chai and chai rooibos, all of which can be ordered hotor iced. The smallest size, 8oz, costs $3.50.The masala chai at Kaldi's is a bit more watery or milky than others, but manages to pack a little morespice than that of Starbucks. Although not overly sweet, the masala chai is still satisfying. In comparison,the chocolate chai tastes like a less thick, more spiced version of hot chocolate. With the lightness oftea, its cocoa undertones mimic the addictiveness of a chocolate bar. The flavor is akin to that of afreshly unwrapped Tootsie Pop. The rooibos chai doesn't have caffeine and is made with different spicesthan the masala chai."Masala [chai] is going to be sweeter and have more flavors like cinnamon, whereas rooibos is going tohave spicier flavors like black pepper," Kaldi's employee Gabrielle Corrigon said.The Kaldi's cup is three-and-a-half inches tall, and on average the foam took up seven-eighths of an inchof the cup. In terms of service, I was served four minutes after arriving at Kaldi's, and if ordered forconsumption on-site, the chai can be served in a classic coffee shop mug.StarbucksPrice: C | Quality: B | Convenience: C | Variety: ALocated in the Oxford Road Building, Starbucks serves the classic masala chai tea latte and the Oprahcinnamon chai tea latte, both of which can be ordered hot or iced.

The Oprah cinnamon chai has a sweeter taste than the original, and is also a bit more spiced,leaving an aftertaste similar to that of a gingerbread Christmas cookie. The original chai is 190 calories,and the Oprah cinnamon chai is 150 calories. The tall cup is four-and-a-quarter inches tall, and foam tookup one-fourth of an inch on average. I was served six minutes after ordering.Peet's Coffee & TeaPrice: B | Quality: B | Convenience: A | Variety: BPeet's is located on the first floor of Woodruff Library, and offers classic masala chai tea lattes, hot oriced. Both cost $3.00 for a 12 oz small. Peet's is definitely the spiciest of the masala chais on campusand is a bit sweeter than the average chai tea latte. Although fairly quick, Peet's Coffee's hot chaiavailability depends on if their machine is working. Many students choose Peet's because of it isconveniently located in the library.Highland BakeryPrice: B | Quality: A | Convenience: C | Variety: BHighland is located in the B-School and the Atwood Chemistry Building, and offers general masala chaihot and iced. A small is 12oz and costs $2.95. Highland Bakery definitely has the sweetest chai oncampus. The tea is milky without losing the classic chai flavors.

The cup had little to no foam.Bhojanic MarketPrice: A | Quality: A | Convenience: A | Variety: CBhojanic Market serves Indian food in Cox Hall and offers a 16 oz iced chai tea priced at $2.95.

They can make the chai with 2percent milk, whole milk, skim milk, soy milk or almond milk. Although milk substitutions can be askedfor at many places around campus, not all have as many options.

Their lattesare smooth, not too spicy and contain approximately a quarter inch of foam, making them a classic andsafe choice.
