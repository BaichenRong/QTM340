Michael Romano, a cognitive scientist whoworks with the partnership, moderated the talk.Lhakdor laid the groundwork for his talk by elaborating the values that Tibetan monks consider their“lifeline.”“The whole Buddhist philosophy is based on the law of nature,” he said. “If you live in harmony … withnature, you will flourish, you will prosper, you will be successful. If you try to be extremely clever and goagainst nature, you will suffer.”With a modern negligence of these values, we risk losing compassion, genuine love and other crucialspiritual values, he said.“We are so intelligent that we forget to live like human beings,” he said. “We live like animals … usingphysical force, stockpiling arms, destroying or threatening the other nation, the other individual.”Lhakdor described to the audience, intensely engaged in his words, a scene of three criminals who are tobe executed in several hours and are treating each other without compassion. While we judge theseconvicts, he said, for wasting their last hours, we are only living 40 or 50 years more than them.Beyond Tibetans’ contributions to the 21st century model, the panelists explored science’s offering toBuddhist philosophy.“One of my goals is to see Tibetan monastics working as real scientists,” Choephel said, adding that oneof his fellow monks, despite some shortcomings, “talks like a real scientist.”Both Choephel and Lhakdor discussed the concept of the 21st century monk. Choephel said he read anarticle that described it as a monk who wears a robe and has a Facebook, to the audiences’ laughter. “Isaid, ‘that’s easy.’ I’m a 21st century monk.”Lhakdor explained further: “A 21st century monk is not just a monk in the 21st century. It’s a monk whodoesn’t study tradition without questioning.”Jampa Khechok, a Tibetan monk who has spent two years at Emory through the partnership andattended Tuesday’s event, said that his stay at a university in the United States has shed new light onthis topic.“Meeting people from different culture[s] and backgrounds,” he said, “has really opened my mind andstrengthened my philosophical basis that we are the same … regardless of color and culture … [We]desire happiness and don’t want suffering.”Khechok said he is working to become a 21st century monk, which he describes as a bird with one wingof modern knowledge and one of traditional knowledge.“The monks should open their heart and mind to learn from another tradition,” he said.Zoie Taylor, a senior from Agnes Scott College who attended the talk as a field trip for a class, waspleased to find that the panel gave her a new take on her international relations major.“I got to see it on an individual level,” Taylor said. “Sometimes in politics, you are looking at the big level.”She added that it was interesting to see people “from different nations sharing knowledge.”​— By Executive Editor Karishma Mehrotra
