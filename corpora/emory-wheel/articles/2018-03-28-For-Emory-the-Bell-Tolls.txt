Before Emory students became accustomed to the tune of the Westminster chimes every 15 minutes,myriad melodies rang out from Cox Hall's Clock Tower, including "The Addams Family" theme song.Officially named the Robinson Clock Tower after former Emory trustee J. William Robinson, the iconictower has soared over Cox Bridge for more than 20 years, relaying songs like the Halloween classicduring special occasions. The tower's electronic carillon, a system which amplifies bell sounds, hasenabled the tower to broadcast those tunes over the past 18 years.University Historian and Senior Adviser to the President Gary Hauk, who was at one point responsiblefor approving Clock Tower song requests, said the tower's electronic sound system once boasted avariety of melodies. The system played "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" on the opening day of the MajorLeague Baseball (MLB) season in the early 2000s, and circus music during a circus-themed Dooley'sWeek in 2011. Hauk recalled hearing the Christmas carol, "The Holly and the Ivy," ring out in December,and once even asked Director of Piano Studies William Ransom to record a few classical songs for thetower."It got to be a little bit tiresome," Hauk said as he recounted hearing tunes resonate from the towermultiple times a day. "We have not had requests for special songs in five or six years," he wrote in aMarch 25 email to the Wheel, adding that the University is reviewing the process for consideringrequests.Today, the tower relays the Westminster chimes every quarter hour and Emory's alma mater at noon,with only a few additional melodies.One of those is the Islamic call to prayer, known as the Adhan. Every Friday in February since 2000 —Islamic Awareness Month — and the month of Ramadan, the call to worship rings out for severalminutes on Emory's campus.Emory's Muslim Students Association (MSA), in collaboration with dean of the chapel and spiritual lifeand the University administration, debuted the tower's Adhan tradition in 2000, according to Religious LifeScholar in the Office of Spiritual and Religious Life (OSRL) Isam Vaid (93Ox, 95C, 99PH).Vaid, the founder of both Oxford's and Emory's MSA, explained that the time at which the tower relaysthe Adhan has varied over the years depending on the length of the day."[The Adhan] can be heard close to the time of Salaat Al-Jum'ah," which is Arabic for Friday prayers,Vaid wrote in a March 22 email to the Wheel. "My observation, over the years, has been that the Adhanhas been well received with widespread appreciation as an expression of inclusiveness."But the tower hasn't always been musically inclined.The Clock Tower was built in the mid-1990s and endured the installation of four cast-bronze bells and anelectronic carillon in 2000 that made it possible for student organizations to request songs through Hauk."There was an initiative to switch out the timing mechanism, install bronze bells and update the system,"Project Manager Alfred Herzog said. Over this two-month period in 2000, the Clock Tower as we know itbegan to take shape.During the renovations, plexiglass panelling was installed on three faces of the tower to direct the soundof its chimes away from the residence halls and hospital, and toward the Quadrangle. But no changeswere made to the exterior of the structure, according to Herzog.As project manager, Herzog coordinates with contractors and architectural engineers on capital projects,which cost more than $1 million. His largest assignment has been the construction of the Campus LifeCenter (CLC).Despite the CLC's modern style, Herzog believes the structure will complement the Clock Tower."Cox Hall is a little more reminiscent of the architecture that we see on most Emory buildings, and theCLC is more modern," Herzog said. "They'll play off each other really well."Although some students today regard the tower as a postcard image for Emory, it has modestlyintegrated its resounding bells into the background noise of the lives of students, hospital employees andUniversity staff and faculty.
