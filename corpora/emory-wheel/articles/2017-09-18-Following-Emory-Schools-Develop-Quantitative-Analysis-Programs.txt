The Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods (QTM) at Emory has caught the attention of topcolleges such as Vanderbilt University (Tenn.) and Dartmouth College (N.H.), which are creating similardepartments in an effort to better prepare students for the workforce.Created in 2011, the QTM Department at Emory teaches students quantitative analysis acrossdisciplines, according to its website. The curriculum aims to provide students technical skills andsubstantive knowledge in a specific field such as law or politics, according to QTM Director andProfessor of Political Science and Law by Courtesy Clifford Carrubba."One of our goals is to demonstrate that in fact liberal arts education and vocational skills arecomplements not substitutes, and that the best education does both," Carrubba said.Looking to Emory as a model, Vanderbilt is designing a similar program for students to develop a strongfoundation in mathematics and quantitative analysis in addition to a substantive area of expertise, saidVanderbilt Professor of Law Alan Wiseman, who chairs a committee tasked with launching the program."The curriculum draws on the programmatic design of Emory's quantitative sciences, and, similar toEmory's program, students are required to take core math and programming courses," Wiseman said.The Vanderbilt committee is still in the process of developing its curriculum and receiving approval, but ithopes to establish the quantitative social sciences (QSS) major by Fall 2018.Emory based its own QTM department on the mathematical methods and social sciences program atNorthwestern University (Ill.), according to Carrubba.In 2011, then-College Dean Robin Forman wanted to create an institute to promote quantitative sciencesat Emory, according to Carrubba. Carrubba expanded on Northwestern's program by composing anundergraduate curriculum that included natural sciences and humanities in addition to social sciences.Professor of Government Michael Herron worked on creating a similar program at Dartmouth, whichformerly had small and outdated mathematical social sciences (MSS) program, according to Herron.In 2014, Herron began creating a QSS program to replace the MSS program. The QSS programreplaced the MSS program at Dartmouth July 2015."It is essentially a combination of ideas from the programs at Northwestern, Emory and the old MSSprogram at Dartmouth," Herron said.The median salary for statisticians and related occupations in 2016 was about $80,500, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics."Choosing (quantitative sciences) as my major was one of the best decisions I have made at Emory,"Ryan Joye (18C) said. "Big data and data-driven decision making has become important in almost everyindustry and academic discipline."Emory's QTM department currently offers two undergraduate degrees: quantitative sciences (QSS) andapplied mathematics and statistics (AMS). The AMS major is offered in partnership with the Departmentof Mathematics and Computer Science, according to Department of Mathematics and ComputerScience Chair Vaidy Sunderam. A QSS minor and a public policy analysis (PPA) major are beingdeveloped, Carrubba said. PPA will be offered Spring 2018, according to the website.Emory QSS majors choose a "track" to specialize in while taking core statistics classes and classes inthe Mathematics and Computer Science Department. There are 16 tracks currently offered, includingbiology, economics and English.Although many students coming in to Emory may not be familiar with the QSS major, some areintroduced to it through Emory's introduction to statistics class, QTM 100. QTM 100 is not required forthe QSS or AMS major, but it is a required course for other majors at Emory, including political science,biology and psychology.Young Hye Lee (20C) said she decided she wanted to major in QSS after taking QTM 100."I loved the class and felt that majoring in QSS would be most useful for me, no matter what path I takefor the future," Lee said.CORRECTION (9/21/18 at 11:36 a.m.): The article was changed to reflect that the AMS major is offeredby the QTM department in partnership with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science andthat math classes that QTM majors take are within the Department of Mathematics and ComputerScience.
