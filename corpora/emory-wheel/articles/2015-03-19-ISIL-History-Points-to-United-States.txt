However, the activities of ISIL don’t simplythreaten the functioning of a single government. Rather, they threaten the effectiveness of everygovernment in the world, thereby creating a global threat.Every time such a powerful and violent force has come into the larger context of international politics,leaders and whole countries have come to question its creation. As the group has caused an undeniabledegree of destruction, it becomes important to consider certain realities about the organization’sexistence: Why and how did it come into being? What causes its continuation? Was the destructioncaused by it avoidable? While it is important to ensure such organizations meet their end, and soon, it isalso essential to consider the aforementioned questions, as to prevent a similar threat from becoming amenace in the future. Further, contemplating such facts can actually provide answers to the pressingquestion: How do we stop them?“A tendency to monopolize the means of violence makes a government’s claim to provide protection …more credible and more difficult to resist.” This sentence perfectly summarized Charles Tilly’s firstargument in his essay, “War Making and State Making as Organized Crime,” which was published in thebook Bringing the State Back In. Tilly represents the state as an all-powerful organization in the businessof organized crime. Because the state has a monopoly over legitimate use of violence, it essentiallybecomes the only institution that can protect individuals from illicit violence being inflicted upon them.What Tilly is trying to describe can also be seen as the existence of a hegemon in the context ofinternational politics. This hegemon, like the state, has a monopoly over the use of force, not by legalcharter or election but because of its military superiority. Thus far, the hegemon has presented itselfmostly in the form of a single state. The United States became a perfect example of a hegemon after theend of the Cold War with the downfall of the Soviet Union. This country’s military “ability” gives it amonopoly on violence, which further feeds it with a sense of freedom to ensure security for humans inany manner possible. The primary method to ensure “security,” if that’s what one chooses to call it, is thepractice of unimaginable violence on anybody or anything that may present itself as a potential threat. Aperfect illustration would be the functioning of Guantanamo Bay where prisoners are made to endurenothing short of barbarism.The second astute observation that Tilly makes is the creation of “bandits” through the support of thestate. “States often commissioned privateers, hired sometimes bandits to raid their enemies andencouraged their regular troops to take booty,” he writes. “When demobilized, they commonly continuedthe same practices, but without the royal protection; demobilized ships became private vessels.”This is reflected in the conception and existence of 21st century terrorist organizations, namely ISIL(originating from Al-Qaeda). Supplemented by both Western as well as local governments, theseorganizations began by doing the states’ bidding. Emerging with the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Al-Qaedaserved as a way for America to fight off the Soviets without directly being involved in the war. Once theirassigned task was completed, however, they developed a mind of their own and questioned problemsthat caused their creation. After its creation in the Soviet-Afghan war, Al-Qaeda, in its crudest form,developed an enmity towards the United States when the Saudi monarch opted for the United Statesover Osama Bin Laden to fight off Iraq in Kuwait.Al-Qaeda, now a “private vessel,” meandered away from the Western ideals. A Sunni organization, theybegan to form roots in most parts of the Middle East. The members of the extremist organization took itupon themselves to ensure that their ideas of social justice and composition prevailed. They began bythreatening the very states that shaped them. Challenging everything Western civilization stood forbecame their motto in a manifesto grounded in the creation of a new world order. Terror became thepropaganda used to make people adhere to their ideals. These ideals and the ideals of most of the worldgovernments were at opposing ends of a spectrum in which only one end could exist. There was noquestion of the possibility of co-existence of the creator and its creation. What was once a solution nowbecame the problem.Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became an organization intended to end the sectarian conflict between Shia andSunni in the worst manner: by seizing power in the central and western areas of the country and forminga Sunni Islamic State. In October 2006, the AQI allied with seven other Sunni factions under the umbrellaname Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). Its constant need of approval from Al-Qaeda resulted in the commonbelief that ISI was born out of Al-Qaeda. However, later on Al-Qaeda completely disowned and severedall ties with ISI.During the Gulf War, the United States and other members of the “coalition of the willing,” an alliancebetween the strongest nations outside of the United Nations peacekeeping force, sought to free Kuwaitfrom the Iraqi invasion. After Kuwait had been freed, Western troops advanced into Iraq but declared aceasefire soon thereafter. However, these troops once again invaded Iraq in 2003 under Operation IraqiFreedom. This time there was no ceasefire. Constant bombarding under the guise of search for weaponsof mass destruction in Iraq resulted in mass destruction across the nation and the ultimate removal ofSaddam Hussein. This creation of a vacuum presented ISIL, a remodel of ISI that now includedmembers of the freshly split Nusra, with an opportunity, one it could not and would not compromise atany cost. The United States and its allies withdrew from a situation in which their purpose had beenachieved. Taking advantage of this withdrawal, ISIL initiated political advancements.ISIL gained momentum, once again, during the resistance against Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria andagainst the Shiite government in Iraq. This event provided ISIL with a chance to expand and establish itsviolent superiority in Syria as well as Iraq. The Western powers turned a blind eye toward the ISIL’sresistance against Assad and the violence imposed by them on innocent Syrians, particularly the Shiites.With the downfall of regimes present in Syria and Iraq, ISIL began taking substantial political control andalso went after the oil fields in the Kurdish region of Syria. But their threat was being felt at the grassrootsas well. From beheadings of people from across the globe for ransom to the immolation of a person of adifferent faith, its activities went from being violent to straight out demonic. Western governments couldno longer turn a blind eye to one of the greatest threats to them in the 21st century.ISIL now presents itself as a multi-headed beast that cannot be slain. In such a situation, the onlypossible means to bring the terrorists down is through war, at least according to Charles Tilly.“But surely part of the answer goes back to the central mechanisms of state making,” he writes.If applied to the current scenario of ISIL, Tilly’s idiom would mean encouraging the creation of coalitionsamong great states to overcome the threat. Alliances have been the key to defeating a supranationaldanger in the past and will continue to be so in the future. However, these allies need to realizesomething after the downfall of such a danger. It is something that they missed after the demise ofOsama Bin Laden, and it is something they may miss again.The provision of guns and ammunition by Western countries for the furtherance of their causes aroundthe globe is the actual culprit. It may seem plausible in the short run to solve problems of local terror andviolence. But in the long run, there is rise of a “gun culture,” especially among the uneducated,unemployed citizens of politically and economically unstable countries. While these guns may do thebidding of the most powerful nation for a while, it is difficult to say where the gun will point next.Pranati Kohli is a College freshman from New Delhi, India.
