Boba Theory, a drinks shop, is set to open at Emory Point on Dec. 19, according to owner Hien Huynh.Boba Theory's first and only other location is in Morrow, Ga., which opened in late 2016.Huynh said he is opening a new location at Emory Point because he wants his business to be close toEmory and its student population."There's nothing around [this area] that provides the boba tea and desserts, and I'm hoping to providethat need for students," Huynh said.Huynh said Boba Theory's menu integrates American flavors with the boba tea and also contains otherproducts like smoothies, slushies, coffee and frappuccinos."Our theory behind it is that we can integrate all of the drinks together in one place," Huynh said. "[It's] acombination of everything."The restaurant is opening for friends and neighbors on Dec. 16 by invitation, Huynh said, and will offerthem free drinks so that they can provide feedback."Different regions require different taste," Huynh said. "We learn from our clients, and then we will startintroducing new things."Huynh said he is working with Uber Eats to establish a delivery program for Boba Theory, but he doesn'texpect delivery service to be ready by opening day.The store is currently hiring new employees, and the training process will begin after this week. Huynhsaid he is looking for Emory students to work at the restaurant.Josh Byland (20C) said he often visits Kung Fu Tea, Sweet Hut and Tea House Formosa for boba, butthey are not in close proximity to Emory's campus."Since [Boba Theory is] in walking distance, I'm gonna visit it for sure," Byland said.Cassandra Wan (22C) expressed similar sentiments as Byland."I haven't been to another Boba Theory location, but since I've moved to Atlanta, I've driven past that onea couple times and I always want to check it out," Wan said.The post Boba Theory to Open at Point appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
