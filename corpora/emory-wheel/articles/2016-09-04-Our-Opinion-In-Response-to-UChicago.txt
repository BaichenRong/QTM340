In a letter to incoming University of Chicago (UChicago) students, Jay Ellison, the dean of students in theCollege, outlined the University's position on so-called "intellectual safe spaces." Linking "intellectual safespaces" with academic censorship, the dean condemned this practice in the name of maintainingfreedom of expression. The letter additionally addresses "trigger warnings" and says the institution doesnot condone their usage.Given recent events at Emory that directly implicate the role of safe spaces and trigger warnings, notablythe Trump chalkings which sparked a dialogue on free speech, this topic remains particularly relevant onour campus. A dialogue regarding safe spaces and trigger warnings is valuable in the reconciliation ofintellectual curiosity with personal aversions.While we applaud UChicago's initiative to preserve the freedom of expression as we, too, fully supportthis aim, we do not believe that the protection of freedom of expression and the concept of safe spacesmutually exclude one another. The safe spaces one creates should not limit speech; they ought toenable and further it. Such spaces should facilitate dialogue because in them discussions occur in ajudgement-free manner, thereby allowing one the liberty to express a variety of perspectives freely andopenly.Emory's current approach to the idea of a safe space is laudable. Neither in the classroom nor aroundthe broader campus is there an active, Administration-based policing of uncensored dialogue or opinions,and nor should there be. The Administration should continue to approach safe spaces with this laissezfaire attitude. If there is an interest to form an organization that can provide an outlet for marginalizedgroups to congregate, the University should facilitate it. Emory has championed this by maintaining acommitment to a student's right to associate, with examples like the Emory Black Student Union andCentro Latino providing such spaces. It must be noted that the University does not directly create theseorganizations, but merely allows them space and financial support — and ensures that these spaces areopen to any member of the broader community.UChicago's interpretation of a safe space neglects to address a very crucial social facet of safe spaces.The letter attacks safe spaces as an official entity, but fails to acknowledge that a safe space, at least byEmory's definition, is policed only by social means. Sure, safe spaces provide a discussion-orientedsphere in which myriad people can participate and voice various opinions. However, that isn't to say thatsome perspectives would not be met with some level of social consequences. If one presents his or herideas in a disruptive manner, it is within the realm of safe spaces and indeed, almost any space, forthose present to request the offender to leave. The offender, however, is by no means required tocomply and will not be subject to any official action unless they have broken any actual University policyor applicable legal statute. Similarly, within the classroom, it is within the professor's prerogative toremove a student — but it ought not be within the bounds of the University's authority.Emory's hands-off approach to safe spaces should extend also to trigger warnings. We recommend thatprofessors use these as tools merely as advisories intended to warn students about potentiallyprovocative course content. Such a measure provides students the opportunity to decide if they want tocontinue with the course. Students who may be reminded of a past traumatic event should not use thesystem as an excuse to not complete an assignment or to skip a class, but rather to prepare himself orherself for a personally difficult discussion.But while we recommend that professors provide these warnings as clearly and as early as possible,they are not and should not be required to do so. Universities should not force professors either toinclude or to avoid these warnings. As a part of the professor's freedom to teach their students as theydeem necessary, they reserve the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to include a triggerwarning.Ultimately, a university administration should allow for the development or usage of both safe spacesand trigger warnings, so long as they do not deviate from the aforementioned definitions.Freedom of expression is paramount in an academic community, and properly-run safe spaces can beused to reinforce its role in our everyday lives.The above staff editorial represents the majority opinion of the Wheel's editorial board.
