More than 300 scientists, public health officials and policymakers convened to discuss climate changeand potential solutions at the Carter Center Feb. 16 following the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention's (CDC) abrupt cancellation of its Climate and Health Summit."Sixteen of the 17 hottest years ever measured with instruments have been since 2001," former VicePresident Al Gore said in his keynote speech. "The hottest year of all was last year â€¦ the third year inthe row that we had the all-time record hot year."The Climate and Health Meeting brought climate change and public health experts together to discussconcerns about and possible solutions to climate change. They urged everyone to remain hopeful andresilient in the fight against climate change despite challenges such as a presidential administration thathas repeatedly denied climate change.Emory's Departments of Environmental Health and Environmental Sciences were co-sponsors of theevent, according to Uriel Kitron, chair of the Department of Environmental Studies."Emory's Departments of Environmental Health and Environmental Sciences were part of a 'partnershipcircle' that offered event organizers help to make sure that meeting did go forward" after hearing that theCDC cancelled its event, O. Wayne Rollins Professor and Chair of Department of Environmental HealthPaige Tolbert said.Gore, who helped organize the conference, discussed what he said are wide-ranging effects of climatechange, from higher rates of foodborne and waterborne diseases to predictions that geographic regionsthat might become uninhabitable. The former vice president noted recent successes in combatingclimate change, such as the growth of solar and wind energy, China's retirement of 103 coal plants andglobal participation in the Paris Agreement last year.Former U.S. President and Emory Distinguished Professor Jimmy Carter delivered an unannouncedspeech at the event, emphasizing that climate change will first impact the poorest populations, some withwhich the Carter Center is heavily involved."When political exigencies press on from the pending or possible disapproval of Congress, the CDC hasto be a little more cautious politically," Carter said. "The Carter Center doesn't."Public health researchers and academics discussed how climate change can worsen public health dueto issues such as lower air quality and heat-related illnesses. Speakers suggested targeting Republicanpoliticians at the state level to support combating climate change and making healthcare companiesmore climate-friendly by being energy efficient in their daily operations.Climate change could affect the health of everyone, regardless of political affiliation, Director of theHarvard Global Health Institute Ashish Jha said."Walls will not keep pathogens [caused by climate change] out," Jha said.The CDC cancelled its planned event "out of fear of retribution from the Trump administration," Jha said,so Gore and several nongovernmental organizations initiated a one-day Climate and Health meeting to fillthe void.Approximately a dozen Emory community members attended the event, according to Tolbert.As co-sponsors, Emory-affiliated individuals were invited to participate in the meeting, with one graduatestudent even staffing the conference, Kitron said.Tolbert said she was especially moved by a panelist who said that there are actions that can be taken tocombat climate change that are "palatable even to conservatives," which Tolbert said is important amidsta contentious political climate.Assistant Professor of Environmental Sciences Eri Saikawa said that the interdisciplinary perspectivespresented on climate change enhanced her understanding of the topic. She pointed to Sam Myers,senior research scientist in Harvard's Department of Environmental Health, who spoke about theimportance of potential nutritional deficiencies from climate change.The U.S. Senate recently confirmed Trump's nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency,Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who has sued the EPA several times over its environmentalrules, according to The New York Times.
